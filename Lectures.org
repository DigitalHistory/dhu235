[[https://uoftdh.slack.com/archives/C016VKN0PUL][Visit the #introductions channel in Slack]]. Write us a little message:
  - What's your name, what are your majors/minors?
  - why are you interested in this class? If the answer is "it's a requirement" then tell us *why you want to do DH*
  - what skills are you hoping to develop here/elsewhere/in future?
  - tell us one interesting fact about yourself that you're willing to share *with everyone in the class* (nothing truly private, please)
  - please also [[https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile][add a profile picture to your slack profile]]: ideally, this should be the same as or similar to your [[https://qstudents.utoronto.ca/how-to-change-or-update-your-profile-in-quercus/][Quercus profile picture]]. It's even better if the picture looks enough like you for me to identify you!  I am very slow with names, so I need all the help I can get.  
  
** DH Minor

- thoughtful attention to *form*, *content*, and their relationship.
- willingness to explore technical skills

** The Humanities
(we'll do more next time)
#+begin_quote
"The humanities—including the study of languages, literature, history, jurisprudence, philosophy, comparative religion, ethics, and the arts—are disciplines of memory and imagination, telling us where we have been and helping us envision where we are going."

--  [[http://www.humanitiescommission.org/_pdf/hss_report.pdf][/The Heart of the Matter/]] (Report of the American Academy of Arts & Science's Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences to the U. S. Congress in June 2013)
#+end_quote

*** The Humanities 
- questions of knowledge:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - do humanists care about *facts*?
  - historical role has been to *create narratives* that connect various parts of the human experience
  - goal was generally not *accumulation of fact* but *understanding of relationships*
  - we live in an age of facts. How should the humanities engage?
*** The Problem of Quantitative Reasoning
Humanists have traditionally disdained mathematical reasoning. Why?
#+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
- it's hard and they don't want to try?
- the "two cultures"? [cite:@Snowtwocultures1993a]
- quantitative data *distorts the questions they want to ask?*
*** The Spectre of Reductionism
#+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
- most empirical disciplines are *atomistic* and, at least much of the time *reductionist*
- humanists are largely interested in *emergent properties* and *experiences*
- How can humanists make use of "data" without losing a "dialectectical" relationship to their material (their texts, the pasts, their artifacts)?
- and so, a dilemma! and one that will not go away.

#+begin_notes
- Digital editing & narratives: making texts and narratives available digitally, allowing readers multimodal ways of accessing a text or a narrative (e.g. viewing transcribed text alongside manuscript of that text; or viewing a project that integrates curated artifacts, digital maps, and recorded interviews)
- Data visualization: giving visual forms to data in order to explore and discern patterns, gain or illustrate insights
- Digital archives: digital (or digitized) collections of primary documents about a place or a community; more broadly, collections of primary documents, e.g. manuscripts, books, letters, photographs, etc.
- Digital mapping: plotting historical or literary data (urban economy, pilgrim routes, artifacts found at different archaeological sites, a character's journey in a book) onto a modern, historical, or imaginary map
- Augmented/virtual reality: using computing to overlay virtual elements onto real landscapes (AR), or using computing tech to simulate an immersive, interactive, three-dimensional virtual environment
- 3D printing: turning a digital model into a real object through additive manufacturing (delicate layering of plastic via 3D printer machine)
- Storytelling & performance: video games, coding as art practice

** From the early Information Age to its Decadent Period
#+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
- Busa: at the optimistic invention of "information" [cite:@Shannonmathematicaltheorycommunication1948a]
  - Cold War: hope; triumph; fear; reason and unreason; "human use of human beings" [cite:@wiener_human_1989]
  - Busa sought to use informatic tools to supplement traditional approaches to traditional questions
- Compare with today
  - ubiquitous informatic devices; surveillance; disinformation; systems manipulation (markets; ballot measures; elections; mass opinions)
  - all work is now "digital", and we take "supplementation" for granted
  - our task in DH has to be: in an era in which subtle thinking appears to be endangered, can we harness the tremendous computational power to *continue to think complex thoughts*, not against the humanistic tradition, but within it?
** Your DH Minor, again
#+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
- The digital part is important: you have to be willing to learn technical skills
- But it's not nearly as important as the humanist part! So you will have to always think hard about texts, about cultural artifacts, about what it means to be human

We would like to acknowledge this sacred land on which the University of Toronto operates. It has been a site of human activity for 15,000 years. This land is the territory of the Huron-Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. The territory was the subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Iroquois Confederacy and Confederacy of the Ojibwe and allied nations to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. Today, the meeting place of Toronto is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work in the community, on this territory.

#+begin_quote
Since the nineteenth century the humanities have generally been defined as /the disciplines that investigate the expressions of the human mind./ Such expressions include language, music, art, literature, theatre, and poetry. [cite:@BodIntroductionQuestPrinciples]

#+end_quote
#+end_slideblock

#+begin_slideblock
#+begin_quote
The humanities come in different forms. They have a memory function by
keeping alive the works from the past and the present, often through collections.
They have an educational function by teaching these works to new generations.
They also have a critical function by interpreting these works for the public at
large. In addition to all this, the humanities have a research function by asking
questions and posing hypotheses regarding humanistic artefacts. [cite:@BodIntroductionQuestPrinciples]
#+end_quote
#+end_slideblock

*** History of "The Humanities"
- the objects of humanistic inquiry have been studied in diverse times and places, using many different methods (e.g., systematic study of /language/ as an abstract human capacity begins sometime between 700 and  400 BCE near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border)
- the term "Humanist" arises in 14^{th} Century Italy (cf. Bod, pp 145 ff), as a contrast to "Divines" whose most exalted objects of study were theological.
- Development of *intellectual disciplines* over the next several centuries slowly separated humanities from the natural and social sciences.
- Formal argument in late c.19 about /Geisteswissenschaften/ ("Sciences of the Spirit" == Humanities) and its distinction from "social" and "Natural"
  - "Understanding" vs. "explaining"
  - *This remains a live debate for us!*

*** "Verstehen" and "Erklären"

#+begin_slideblock
#+begin_quote
"Nature we explain, psychic life we understand (Die Natur *erklären* wir, das Seelenleben *verstehen* wir)." [cite:@DiltheyIdeenuberbeschreibende1957]
#+end_quote
#+end_slideblock
#+begin_slideblock
#+begin_quote
The human sciences must hold on to the original presence of this directly known reality even as they proceed to use the intellectual tools of conceptual cognition in their analysis of partial contents. The way the historical world is represented and analyzed must in some way still reflect the way history has been lived. The final understanding (Verstehen) aimed at by Dilthey’s human sciences must draw on all our capacities and is to be distinguished from the mere intellectual and abstract understanding (Erklären/Verstand) of Kant’s natural sciences. 
[cite:@MakkreelWilhelmDilthey2021]

*** "Verstehen" and "Erklären"

- We study the works of human culture in an effort to come to grips, not with "what humans are", but with *what it means to be human*
- The question is: what are the best *methods* for answering that question?
- In addition to "data" we need
  - synthetic understanding
  - empathy
  - creativity

*** Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis
- Humanities disciplines are not all the same, but for the most part they have always employed some kind of *qualitative analysis*
- Computation has tremendously powerful applications for *quantitative analysis*
- So... what exactly does DH bring to the table?
  - treat *text as data*
  - compare *large numbers of texts/objects*
  - *allow large-scale collaboration*
  - provide a *media infrastructure* for disciplinary conversation.

We would like to acknowledge this sacred land on which the University of Toronto operates. It has been a site of human activity for 15,000 years. This land is the territory of the Huron-Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. The territory was the subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Iroquois Confederacy and Confederacy of the Ojibwe and allied nations to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. Today, the meeting place of Toronto is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work in the community, on this territory.

*** History of Criticism
- from Dante: the idea of /reading against the grain of the work/ as an act of devotion:
  #+begin_quote
   a poem has a determinate conceptual intelligibility, and while one may mistake it, or grasp it partially or inadequately, it nonetheless subsists, just as a transcendentally intelligible Word subsists behind or within all creation. 
  #+end_quote
- from Dickinson: the idea that /a work of art has the possibility to mean many things/:
  #+begin_quote
  In this perspective, the critical and interpretive question is not "what does the poem mean?" but "how do we release or expose the poem’s possibilities of meaning?"
  #+end_quote
*** Deformance: expose new possibilities of meaning
- "portmaneau" of /deformation/ and /performance/
- it *creates new possibilities*:
  #+begin_quote
  Far more important is the stochastic process it entails. Reading Backward is a highly regulated method for disordering the senses of a text. It turns off the controls that organize the poetic system at some of its most general levels. When we run the deformative program through a particular work we cannot predict the results. As Dickinson elegantly puts it, “A Something overtakes the Mind,” and we are brought to a critical position in which we can imagine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know. 
  #+end_quote
  #+begin_quote
  There is one other important result. A deformative procedure puts the reader in a highly idiosyncratic relation to the work. This consequence could scarcely be avoided, since deformance sends both reader and work through the textual looking glass. On that other side customary rules are not completely short-circuited, but they are held in abeyance, to be chosen among (there are many systems of rules), to be followed or not as one decides. Deformative moves reinvestigate the terms in which critical commentary will be undertaken.

- this process *is not mere randomness*. It is informed by
  - prior knowledge of the poem and its context, and
  - familiarity with critical literature
 
** Tokenization and *algorithmic* deformation
- Note that deformation, as described, consists mostly in the *application of some set of rules to the poem*
- in order to do this, we need some concept of *the parts of the poem*, their *relationships*, and the *rules of transformation*
- formal division of a text into parts is called "tokenization"
  - find individual "tokens" of particular "types"

*** Encodings
- HTML is a text encoming system
- but of course there are many others, often with different purposes!
- HTML is a *web standard* but there are other *standards*
- [[https://tei-c.org/][TEI]] is an influential standard designed *by and for* humanists for *encoding textual complexity*
*** TEI is XML
- the *eXtensible Markup Language* looks a bit like HTML but is much more complex
- remains a key technology in many domains (e.g., your word docs and powerpoints slides are written in XML)
- built with similar syntax but much, much more powerful
- also *way* harder to read

They all follow the same pattern: 
- first, a *selector* that identifies the elements to which these instructions will apply
- then *an open brace* "{" which marks the start of the actual instructions
- then a series of *property-value pairs*.  Each of these sets the /value/ of a particular /property/ (duh).  Note that at the end of a property, there is *always* a semi-colon!

** Some CSS Rules
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 03-03-css
:END:
*** Display and Visibility
- display: tells the browser how to manage the selected element in the document flow:
  - *block* means "give this element its own line,"
  - *inline* means "use the line (or box) that the parent element has already defined"
  - *none* means "just don't use display this element at all" -- it will be removed from the screen
- visibility: tells the browser to hide the text, but still *reserve the space that it would normally take up*
*** color and background-color
- ~color~ sets the text content color
- ~background-color~ sets the background color 
- you can use the pre-defined named colors like white, black, magenta, fuchsia, etc
- or you can use rgb values (red,green, blue values between 0 and 255): ~rgb(127,127,127)~ is grey, for instance
- or you can use hex values: ~#888888~ is also grey
*** font-style and font-weight
- font-style can be set to ~italic~
- font-weight can be set to ~bold~ or ~normal~
*** Other Rules/values

- think about what effect you want to achieve
- then google around/ask in Slack about how to do it!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed in exclusive and stable property. If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but *the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one,* and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. *That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them,* like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.

*** Al-Kolera ("Cholera"), 1947 -- in context 
- September 1947: first reports of cholera in Egypt
- Reports of the dead piling up in downtown Cairo broadcast by radio throughout Middle East
- At age 24, Al-Malaika hears these reports in her hometown Baghdad
- and writes the poem, her first in Free Verse
  - Free Verse: modernist movement in poetry, move away from formal requirements of meter, number of lines, rhyme, etc.
    - arises as a formal movement in 19th C France ("/vers libre/")
    - becomes popular in the 1920's in English
    - very divergent from classical Arabic poetry, which has strict meter and rhyme requirements
    - "Al-Kolera" is perhaps the first free verse poem written in Arabic; heavily influenced by European Romantic & modernist poetry movements

#+begin_verse
The night is still.
Listen to the beat of lamentations
Deep in the dark, beneath the silence, for the dead.
Cries that rise and clash against each other,
Sadness that drowns then catches fire,
    Wails that stumble over their own echoes.
Every heart is fevered,
Every home is full of sorrow,
Everywhere a soul screams in the dark,
    Everywhere a voice cries out,
    This is what death has torn apart.
    Death, death, death
O sadness of the Nile weeping at the work of death.

Dawn is risen.
Listen to the tread of mourners
In the dawn’s silence. Look and listen to the grieving parade.
Ten dead, twenty,
Too many to count. Listen to those who weep,
   Listen to the sound of the poor child.
The dead, the numberless dead,
The dead with no tomorrow.
Everywhere the bereaved wail over corpses
   Without memorial, without peace.
   Such is the work of death
   Death, death, death
Mankind wails and wails at what death has done.

Cholera
In a cave of terror and corpses,
In the cruel, eternal silence where death is the only cure,
The plague of cholera wakes.
Hungry for vengeance, it drives implacably
   Down into the bright, happy valley.
It shrieks in crazed confusion,
Heedless of lamentations.
Its claws leave marks everywhere.
   At home in the peasant woman’s hut
   There is nothing but screams of death.
   Death, death, death
Death takes its vengeance wearing the mask of cholera.

The silence is bitter.
No sound but plaintive echoes.
Even the gravedigger lies in his grave. No succor.
The mosque’s muezzin is no more.
Who will eulogize the dead?
    Nothing but wails and lamentation.
The child without mother or father
Cries with a fevered heart
And soon evil will certainly snatch him away.
   O specter of cholera, you leave behind nothing
   But the cries of the dead.
   Death, death, death
O Egypt, I am shattered by what death has done.

** Today
- discuss disease
- thoughts about assignment
- intor to Omeka (final assignment framework)
** The Long Arc of Disease
- in 2019, we lived in a relatively epidemic-free moment in human history
- not anymore!
- what can we learn from the broad sweep of human encounters with widespread infections disease?
** Some moments in Pandemic History
- actual "plague": 3 pandemics: "Justinian" (6th C CE), "Black Death" (1346-~1700), "Modern Plague" (mid-c.19-~1959)
- Syphilis (~1500-early c.20)
- Cholera: early c.19-present
- AIDS: late c.20-present
- Ebola: 2014-present

(many others)
** Disease *in* and *as* culture
- diseases have *many cultural effects*
- also, we *understand disease* in culturally-specific ways
- "dialectical" (or "feedback") relationships
- literature as *reflection* and *generator* of understanding
** Breakout groups: how to do this
- quickly assign someone as record keeper. This person will *report back in real time *in Slack*, where everyone ca see the conversation
- meanwhile, I will float around and listen in -- not to eavesdrop, but to be helpful 
** COMMENT "Meaning of Contagion"
- what is the thesis of this essay (approx)?
- did you have trouble understanding it? what parts?
- what struck you as particularly interesting/insightful?
** COMMENT Masque of the Red Death
- Let's spend some time understanding this text:
  - What do you know about the author & their place in the history of literature?
  - did you understand the plot/sequence of events? Was it interesting/compelling? was it irritating/frustrating?
  - beyond plot: how would you characterize the story *thematically*?
  - if you were to construct a website around this story... how would you start?

*** Add an Item: Dublin Core Metadata

- In the Item's fields, enter the metadata: Title, Subject, Description, etc. Before you add items to your collection, you will have figured out how the Dublin Core metadata schema applies to your particular data: consistency across your collection is key.
- For example, for medieval manuscripts, you can list authors of the texts under Author: but what of known scribes, who may have also intervened in the text? Are they Authors or Publishers or Contributors? Pick what makes sense and apply it consistently.
- For details on Dublin Core :
- http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/
- If you wish the Item to be visible on the public view of the site, check “Public" (under “Add Item").
- Click “Add Item" (green, right).

  - What is the story about?
  - If you were to choose this story as your "Plague Lit" artifact, what *historical contexts* would matter?
  - What *literary traditions* would you need to investigate?
  - What *actually interests you* about the story? Note: You don't have to *enjoy* the story to be *interested in how it operates*, just like you don't have to *enjoy* cancer to be an oncologist, or *enjoy* fascism to be a historian of the Nazi period.
    - Are there *themes* or *stylistic elements* to which you might want to call attention?

    - what kinds of *items* would you add to Omeka?

Once you have assembled your material, digitization work can begin. You'll need a specialized camera that can capture the colours of your manuscript, the tiny details (some not visible to the naked eye), erasures, scribal doodles, the marginal notes written by scribes and readers over the years, even bookworm damage. You'll need a cradle to support the manuscript. You'll need a conservation-friendly room, where you can control all the light sources, to make sure you take the clearest, most accurate photograph.

Let me tell you the story of the two Doomsday Books. The firsts is a Latin manuscript of the eleventh century: for taxation purposes, William the Conqueror ordered a record made of landholders and their property in much of England and parts of Wales. The book was finished in 1086 and it resides at The National Archives at Kew, London.

The second Doomsday Book was a BBC initiative, 900 years later: an attempt to build a “digital snapshot of the country,” a documentation of everyday life in communities around the United Kingdom. Over a million people contributed. 

The BBC Domesday Project was stored on adapted laser discs. Reading these discs required a state-of-the-art microcomputer, the Acorn BBC Master, customized with a specially produced laserdisc player.

Unfortunately, as the machines became obsolete, the laser discs and the data on them became unreadable. Until, roughly, 2011. After efforts by academics and technologists around the world, the BBC's own technologists, George Auckland and his Innovations Team, completed the extraction of the laser disc. The BBC Domesday Book is now available to the world at large online.

#+begin_notes 
Storing the data on your own machine is very risky. If you put it in Dropbox or Google Drive, that's better, but not perfect: what if you or a team member deletes the data by accident? Even better if you have multiple off-site backups: so if e.g. Dropbox has a security failure and your own computer is compromised, you can still get your data from the hard-drive at your parents'. Even better: GitHub (which is a platform that tracks versions of your data, where you have the history of your data and can go back to earlier versions).

If you're a research institution, you have some other, even safer options.

Your institutional repository is maintained by the library: it's a place to park your data that has sophisticated technical safeguards against data degradation.

If one institutional repository is nice, more are even better. LOCKSS is an open-source preservation system that sustains a distributed network of institutional repositories. It's like storing your backup hard-drive at your parents' and having them store their hard-drive at your house. In other words, everyone protects everyone else's data. LOCKSS stands for “lots of copies keep stuff safe.” And for additional protection, there are dark archives, for disaster recovery. These keep data secret and inaccessible until a trigger event such as a natural disaster or another kind of catastrophic data loss.

Think about the residential school system in Canada, under which about 150,000 First Nation, Inuit and Métis children were removed from their communities, forced to attend residential schools, not allowed to speak their first language, not allowed to practice native traditions. Many were starved, beaten, sexually abused. Two days ago, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne officially apologized to First Nations, Metis, and Inuit communities for the abuses of the residential school system. Part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's work has been to uncover this history. It is not recovery. It is not undoing of cultural genocide. But, and I quote the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, “A shared vision held by those affected by Indian residential schools was to create a place of learning and dialogue where the truths of their experiences were honoured and kept safe for future generations. They wanted their families, communities and all of Canada to learn from these hard lessons so they would not be repeated.” The Governing Circle of the archive must “ensure Indigenous control over the materials, ensure Indigenous control over the materials; provide guidance on policies, activities, ceremonies and protocols; and provide guidance on methods and sources for expanding the Centre's holdings and resources.” The archive does not turn back time. But it safeguards the past and, in so doing, opens up possible futures.

*  Data 1: Data Models for the Humanities
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 09-data-1
:END:

** What is Data?
#+begin_quote
Data pass themselves off as mere descriptions of a priori conditions. Rendering /observation/ (the act of creating a statistical, empirical, or subjective account or image) as if it were /the same as the phenomena observed/ collapses the critical distance between the phenomenal world and its interpretation, undoing the basis of interpretation on which humanistic knowledge production is based. We know this. But we seem ready and eager to suspend critical judgment in a rush to visualization.
#+end_quote

** Data and Capta
#+begin_quote
To overturn the assumptions that structure conventions acquired from other domains requires that we re-examine the intellectual foundations of digital humanities, putting techniques of graphical display on a foundation that is humanistic at its base. /This requires first and foremost that we reconceive all data as capta/. Differences in the etymological roots of the terms data and capta make the distinction between constructivist and realist approaches clear. /Capta/ is “taken” actively while /data/ is assumed to be a “given” able to be recorded and observed. From this distinction, a world of differences arises. Humanistic inquiry acknowledges the situated, partial, and constitutive character of knowledge production, the recognition that knowledge is constructed, /taken/, not simply given as a natural representation of pre-existing fact.

#+end_quote
** Preserving Humanistic Inquiry

#+begin_quote
The polemic I set forth here outlines several basic principles on which to proceed differently by suggesting that what is needed is not a set of applications to display humanities “data” but a new approach that uses humanities principles to constitute capta and its display. At stake, as I have said before and in many contexts, is the authority of humanistic knowledge in a culture increasingly beset by quantitative approaches that operate on claims of certainty. Bureaucracies process human activity through statistical means and when the methods grounded in empirical sciences are put at the service of the social sciences or humanities in a crudely reductive manner, basic principles of critical thought are violated, or at the very least, put too far to the side. To intervene in this ideological system, humanists, and the values they embrace and enact, must counter with conceptual tools that demonstrate humanities principles in their operation, execution, and display. 
#+end_quote

** Ambiguity as /merely irreducible/ or /constitutive/

#+begin_quote
But an important distinction needs to be clear from the outset: the task of representing ambiguity and uncertainty has to be distinguished from a second task -- that of using interpretations that arise in observer-codependence, characterized by ambiguity and uncertainty, as the basis on which a representation is constructed. This is the difference between putting many kinds of points on a map to show degrees of certainty by shades of color, degrees of crispness, transparency etc., and creating a map whose basic coordinate grid is constructed /as an effect/ of these ambiguities. In the first instance, we have a standard map with a nuanced symbol set. In the second, we create a non-standard map that expresses the constructed-ness of space.

** Spatiality
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_extra_attr: class="twoc"
:END:

#+begin_slideblock
#+begin_quote
We can construct a concrete example of spatiality that parallels this example of temporality, and also depends on temporal models. For instance, imagine an open stretch of beach, relatively unconstrained and unconstructed. When a sailing ship is washed up at a certain point on the beach, not only that point, but the space around it, becomes transformed. The presence of the wreck creates a huge impact, and the space almost palpably bends, compresses, expands, and warps around it, with waves of resonance rippling outward from that point.

#+begin_quote
Figure 14. 

In this example, a geographical space (a stretch of beach) is affected by a change in the state or circumstance. First we see the space mapped according to a regular Cartesian coordinate system. Then the grid is inflected by the arrival of a beached ship, around which the beach bends because the sense of each spot as relative equal is distorted by the attention that the ship commands. The space acquires one inflection after another as graffiti marks the ship, a chain link fence goes up with a police notice, footprints create a pattern in the sand, pathways for observation re-route pedestrian traffic etc. The “space” of the beach is transformed physically and in terms of attention getting and effect so that it is no longer a set of equal and neutral elements of a rational spatial system, but one that must be expressed with graphical distortions that show these inflections.

It is then a striking instantiation of archival silence that when you perform a "Name" search for a person named James Hemings in the /The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Digital Edition/, you get no results---because Hemings, in spite of his ability to read and write in two languages--because of his status as a slave--was not a person to whom Jefferson ever wrote, or from whom Jefferson received letters."

"Who are those dots? Each individual had a profile, age, size, health, economic potential, family and social roles. [...] But what if we take the rate of deaths, their frequency, and chart that on a temporal axis inflected by increasing panic. Then give a graphical expression to the shape of the terrain, that urban streetscape, as it is redrawn to express the emotional landscape. Then imagine drawing this same streetscape from the point of view of a mother of six young children, a recent widow, a small child, or an elderly man whose son has just died" (Drucker, “[[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html][Humanities Approaches]]").

*** Some Rules of Thumb

- in general, creative relationships to data/capta are *more* work than rigourous but straightforward quantitative analysis
- they require familiarity both *both* humanities concepts *and* the underlying technologies
- humaniites tools, though, try to *lower the barrier to entry* and so *often hide the underlying technology*.
- this lets you *play* with visualization but is rarely sufficient to bring *rela insights* and *creative accomplishments*

*** Data Visualization: Play Time

** COMMENT getting myself started
Start with [[file:resources/openrefine/Slides.pdf][The Original Slides]]
- also use the [[https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/fetch-and-parse-data-with-openrefine][Programming Historian]] Slides 
** Working with Messy Data
- As we have discussed, the world is messy, data needs to be clean / assumes cleanliness
- This introduces some problems for humanists! We  will largely  set them aside for the moment (but keep thinking)
- OpenRefine is one of many tools that can be used to clean data
- for more complex operations, can be augmented by a scripting language (Python, R, Julia, etc.) 
** Objectives for This Week
- Introduce OpenRefine & the Interface
- Use sample datasets to Understand how cleaning works
- Learn where to go next for more complex operations
- think about how we could use this in the humanities, and what additional issues we might face as humanists 
** OpenRefine
According to its creator, it is:
#+begin_quote
- more powerful than a spreadsheet
- more interactive and visual than scripting
- more provisional / exploratory / experimental / playful than a database
#+end_quote
Also:
- runs locally, but in a browser
[[https://openrefine.org/download.html][Official Download instructions here, if you missed them in the course instructions]]
** Cleaning
- we use OpenRefine to *clean* data
- this is a boring, but important, and sometimes difficult, step
- there are many ways to clean data, but OpenRefine strikes a very nice balance between *power* and *usability*
- Data cleaning is not *epistemologically neutral*: it reorganizes the world when you do it. 
** Your Tasks
- Complete the Data Cleaning course as discussed in announcements and modules
- Complete a short response to the course and hand it in (link will be in modules)
* temorarily splitting this lecture and adding a conclusion above -- only for convenience. 
** Household Expenditures
- First, open this spreadhseet in Excel (or whatever spreadsheet program you use) and let's look at it.
- Note the format & category choices

- [[file:resources/openrefine/Survey_of_household_spending.xlsx][This link goes to a file on my local computer -- won't work for you!]]

** Starting OpenRefine
Follow [[https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/running][the instructions here]], but basically:
- windows: double click ~openrefine.exe~
- mac: find openrefine in your Applications folder
- linux: if installed via yr package manager, type ~openrefine~ at the command line
  - if donwloaded form website, navigate to installation folder, open a terminal there, and type ~./refine~
- now open http://localhost:3333
** Create a new Project with Household Expenses
- browse for the ~Survey_of_household_expenses.xlsx file~
- remove first 5 lines, then
- import create project

*** Some basic cleaning
- remove empty column
- set view to ~50~
- fill down geography
- Trim whitespace in  ~househould expenditures~ (~Edit Cells → Common transforms → trim whitespace~)

*** Viewing 
- sort, remove sort
- filter, facet
*** Transposing Data
- switch from "wide" to "long" data
- ~Transpose → Trnaspose Cells across columns into Rows~
  - choose ~from~ *2010* ~to~ *2016*
  - Transpose into *Year* (key) and *AvgExp* (value)
 
*** Modify Data in Place Using Facets

*** Explore: 
- what did average BC household spend on pet food?
*** GREL
- upper/lowercase of column names
** New Project with iNaturalist
- navigate to [[file:resources/openrefine/citizenscience.csv][citizenscience.csv(again, only for me)]]
- this time just create project (no need for more complex manipulation)
- this is *crowdsourced* data. What might some ofh tei ssues be? 
*** Clustering
- fnd the ~species_guess~ column, and make a text fact
- chose the "cluster" button, and see what it does
*** Split
- split ~species~ into 2 columns
*** Explore
- split ~species_guess~ into ~genus_guess~ and ~epithet_guess~; which is the most popular value of ~gunus_guess~?
*** Concatenate/Join
- a: join  columns (~Edit Column → Join~)
- b: concatenate (~Edit Column → Add Column based on this Column → GREL Expression~)
*** Explore
- Combine the scientific_name and common_name columns using both of these methods
*** Removing/Reordering
- rmeove some unused licences
- move licence, quality grade, species info to the fornt
*** Flagging
- facet by license/true, quality/casual
- flag these rowse
- unfacet
- refacet on flags (in "all)
- remove matching (also in "all")
*** Undo/Redo/Extract/Apply
- long list of undo 
- you can *navigate through this list*
- be careful not to *lose work* while exploring!
-

** Alec
- Daston 2020 (not 2021)
- can you talk in more detail and with more nuance about "true" and "false" claims? Like, cna you discuss how people decide what information sources are "authoritative"?
- re: vaccine efficacy more specifcally: this doesn't feel to me like "misinformation" exactly.  So htere's something more complex htat has to be conveyed here.

It may help you to see a few more tags. Here is a slightly more complex example, with a more completely marked-up selection of the poem. I have *not* annotated this example, but it showcases a few more features of the systems we're learning.  In particular, this example introduces:
- [[https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp][more complex colors]]
- [[https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp][the "a" or hyperlink tag]]
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10395488/how-to-concat-a-string-to-xslvalue-of-select][curly braces as a shortcut for xpaths]]
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11744465/xpath-difference-between-node-and-text][the somewhat confusing xpath test "node"]], which sometimes makes sense to use when "current()" doesn't produce the effect you want.
