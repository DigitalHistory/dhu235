- Every exportable entry must have the ~EXPORT_FILE_NAME~ property set before export.
- I should write some code to shunt this stuff to ox-huveal instead of ox-hugo.  This is a project for another time.
- interestingly, I probably don't want to set ox-hugo-auto-export-on-save for this file, because my most urgent need is going to be to export local reveal files.  Exporting to hugo -- or huveal if I can figure that out -- will be difficult.
- so, maybe I want to repurpose some of the auto-export code for use with my lectures!

#+begin_notes
Digital archives provide access to material that may be housed far from a scholar's physical location. Ten years ago, I had to travel to the British Library to work with their medieval manuscripts. (Incidentally, I still have the sketches I made of their illumination. In pencil, because you can't take pens into the reading room.) I got to handle a fourteenth-century manuscript, its parchment pages as supple, its illuminations as vivid as the day the book was scribed. I sat in the special collections library for seven hours. I looked at the illuminations; I handled the parchment, noting the differences between hair side and flesh side (parchment is made of animal skin, so you can see which side faced the outside and which faced the inside of the animal). For days, my hands smelled like goat.

Now, I am able to access the images in the manuscript online---anytime, from my office at UofT. I can compare the images to other manuscripts of the Book of John Mandeville. I can study them, annotate them, put them in Powerpoints, and reference them robustly in scholarly arguments.

It would be possible to enumerate all of the filmic conventions that recall the conventions of melodrama. Is there a villain? Is there a heroine? Are good and evil depicted in stark, black-and-white terms? You could even build a dataset like this and use it to show how film changed over time.
| Title                 | Year | Virtuous Heroine | Cruel Villain | Terrible evil | Heroine in peril | Broad gestures |
| The Lonedale Operator | 1911 | x                | x             | x             | x                | x              |

#+begin_notes
Each record of an archive is described by metadata: structured data about data. For example, think about your library's online catalogue: it contains the records of books, with fields like Author, Title, Publisher, Editor, Date. If you use standard metadata schemas, like Dublin Core, MARC, or MODS, your data will be discoverable and interoperable with aggregators and library catalogues.

#+begin_quote
“A controlled vocabulary is an organized arrangement of words and phrases used to catalog content and/or to retrieve content through browsing or searching. It typically includes preferred and variant terms and has a defined scope or describes a specific domain. [...] While capturing the richness of variant terms, controlled vocabularies also promote consistency in preferred terms and the assignment of the same terms to similar content.”

- The practice of systematizing controlled vocabularies so descriptors of entities are unique, non-overlapping, and consistently used--e.g. having an accepted set of “correct” subject headings
