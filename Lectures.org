- Every exportable entry must have the ~EXPORT_FILE_NAME~ property set before export.
- I should write some code to shunt this stuff to ox-huveal instead of ox-hugo.  This is a project for another time.
- interestingly, I probably don't want to set ox-hugo-auto-export-on-save for this file, because my most urgent need is going to be to export local reveal files.  Exporting to hugo -- or huveal if I can figure that out -- will be difficult.
- so, maybe I want to repurpose some of the auto-export code for use with my lectures!

#+begin_notes
Digital archives provide access to material that may be housed far from a scholar's physical location. Ten years ago, I had to travel to the British Library to work with their medieval manuscripts. (Incidentally, I still have the sketches I made of their illumination. In pencil, because you can't take pens into the reading room.) I got to handle a fourteenth-century manuscript, its parchment pages as supple, its illuminations as vivid as the day the book was scribed. I sat in the special collections library for seven hours. I looked at the illuminations; I handled the parchment, noting the differences between hair side and flesh side (parchment is made of animal skin, so you can see which side faced the outside and which faced the inside of the animal). For days, my hands smelled like goat.

Now, I am able to access the images in the manuscript online---anytime, from my office at UofT. I can compare the images to other manuscripts of the Book of John Mandeville. I can study them, annotate them, put them in Powerpoints, and reference them robustly in scholarly arguments.

Humanities data has depth in small universes. Our material has the capacity to unfold inwards, as it were, to disclose layer upon layer of insights and connections, within a comparatively tiny amount of data--almost an inverse matryoshka, as it were, where each inner doll is bigger and more complex than the one encasing it.

- Digital editing & narratives: making texts and narratives available digitally, allowing readers multimodal ways of accessing a text or a narrative (e.g. viewing transcribed text alongside manuscript of that text; or viewing a project that integrates curated artifacts, digital maps, and recorded interviews)
- Data visualization: giving visual forms to data in order to explore and discern patterns, gain or illustrate insights
- Digital archives: digital (or digitized) collections of primary documents about a place or a community; more broadly, collections of primary documents, e.g. manuscripts, books, letters, photographs, etc.
- Digital mapping: plotting historical or literary data (urban economy, pilgrim routes, artifacts found at different archaeological sites, a character's journey in a book) onto a modern, historical, or imaginary map
- Augmented/virtual reality: using computing to overlay virtual elements onto real landscapes (AR), or using computing tech to simulate an immersive, interactive, three-dimensional virtual environment
- 3D printing: turning a digital model into a real object through additive manufacturing (delicate layering of plastic via 3D printer machine)
- Storytelling & performance: video games, coding as art practice
