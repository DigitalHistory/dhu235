 - Intro       
 - What is DH? 
 - DH: A partial history 
 - Course syllabus 
 - Project examples (will move mostly to async)
 - A Little Game, a little thinking
   
*** Patience and Attention!
- Online classes move *slowly*! Async lectures will help a little, but please be patient
- Even so, *please pay attention* or this will be much harder!

*** Sign up for Slack!
I'd like to keep all chat *in Slack* during class.  So please click on this link in your copy of the lecture notes:

*** Chat & Hand-raising
- please feel free to chat in the ~#meeting-1~ channel in slack
- I likely can't respond to everything
- if you need to get my attention, signal with the BB Collaborate *hand raising* action
- Please please please please *add profile photos* to your BB Collaborate personas so I know you are not automata

- will test out "breakout rooms"
- take 10 minutes to find out this info from others in the room:
  - name, majors, is this person a DH minor?
  - why interested in class?
  - what skills are they hoping to develop here/elsewhere/in future?
  - one interesting fact the person is willing to share *with everyone in the class* (nothing private)
- Everyone in the group should write a message in Slack *introducing one other person*.

- what does this tell us exactly?
- not a static definition!
- far enough away from the interface, it is just "humanities" or "computer science"

** DH Minor
- exposure to established tools (but these change!)
- awareness of *what the humanities are*
- thoughtful attention to *form*, *content*, and their relationship.

- Digital editing & narratives: making texts and narratives available digitally, allowing readers multimodal ways of accessing a text or a narrative (e.g. viewing transcribed text alongside manuscript of that text; or viewing a project that integrates curated artifacts, digital maps, and recorded interviews)
- Data visualization: giving visual forms to data in order to explore and discern patterns, gain or illustrate insights
- Digital archives: digital (or digitized) collections of primary documents about a place or a community; more broadly, collections of primary documents, e.g. manuscripts, books, letters, photographs, etc.
- Digital mapping: plotting historical or literary data (urban economy, pilgrim routes, artifacts found at different archaeological sites, a character's journey in a book) onto a modern, historical, or imaginary map
- Augmented/virtual reality: using computing to overlay virtual elements onto real landscapes (AR), or using computing tech to simulate an immersive, interactive, three-dimensional virtual environment
- 3D printing: turning a digital model into a real object through additive manufacturing (delicate layering of plastic via 3D printer machine)
- Storytelling & performance: video games, coding as art practice

We would like to acknowledge this sacred land on which the University of Toronto operates. It has been a site of human activity for 15,000 years. This land is the territory of the Huron-Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. The territory was the subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Iroquois Confederacy and Confederacy of the Ojibwe and allied nations to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. Today, the meeting place of Toronto is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work in the community, on this territory.

[E]ven doorknobs have politics in that they may be round, requiring a human hand to turn them, or shaped as levers, such that a person with a prosthetic limb or an armload of groceries with one free elbow can still successfully use them. This is more than simply a matter of utility. Both designs are political in that they presume and construct different kinds of worlds, with the round doorknob presuming a world in which everyone’s bodies are the same, and in which hands with opposable thumbs and sufficient grip strength are always available

“When you call something data, you imply that it exists in discrete, fungible units; that it is computationally tractable; that its meaningful qualities can be enumerated in a finite list; that someone else performing the same operations on the same data will come up with the same results.

It would be possible to enumerate all of the filmic conventions that recall the conventions of melodrama. Is there a villain? Is there a heroine? Are good and evil depicted in stark, black-and-white terms? You could even build a dataset like this and use it to show how film changed over time.
| Title                 | Year | Virtuous Heroine | Cruel Villain | Terrible evil | Heroine in peril | Broad gestures |
| The Lonedale Operator | 1911 | x                | x             | x             | x                | x              |

When you look at a CSS file, you will see it is divided into a bunch of stanzas, like this.  Each of these stanzas is called a "selector statement":
They all follow the same pattern: 
- first, a *selector* that identifies the elements to which these instructions will apply
- then *an open brace* "{" which marks the start of the actual instructions
- then a series of *property-value pairs*.  Each of these sets the /value/ of a particular /property/ (duh).  Note that at the end of a property, there is *always* a semi-colon!  
- finally, *a closing brace* that ends the selector declaration.

- the *eXtensible Markup Language* looks a bit like HTML but is much more complex
- remains a key technology in many domains (e.g., your word docs and powerpoints slides are written in XML)
- built with similar syntax but much, much more powerful
- also *way* harder to read

* Some CSS Rules
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 03-03-css
:END:
** Display and Visibility
- display: tells the browser how to manage the selected element in the document flow:
  - *block* means "give this element its own line,"
  - *inline* means "use the line (or box) that the parent element has already defined"
  - *none* means "just don't use display this element at all" -- it will be removed from the screen
- visibility: tells the browser to hide the text, but still *reserve the space that it would normally take up*
** color and background-color
- ~color~ sets the text content color
- ~background-clor~ sets the background color 
- you can use the pre-defined named colors like white, black, magenta, fuchsia, etc
- or you can use rgb values (red,green, blue values between 0 and 255): ~rgb(127,127,127)~ is grey, for instance
- or you can use hex values: ~#888888~ is also grey
** font-style and font-weight
- font-style can be set to ~italic~
- font-weight can be set to ~bold~ or ~normal~
** Other Rules/values

- think about what effect you want to achieve
- then google around/ask in Slack about how to do it!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed in exclusive and stable property. If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but *the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one,* and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. *That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them,* like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.

- also, we *understand disease* in culturally-specific ways
- "dialectical" (or "feedback") relationships
- literature as *reflection* and *generator* of understanding
** Breakout groups: how to do this

  - What do you know about the author & their place in the history of literature?
  - did you understand the plot/sequence of events? Was it interesting/compelling? was it irritating/frustrating?
  - beyond plot: how would you characterize the story *thematically*?

*** Add an Item: Dublin Core Metadata

- In the Item's fields, enter the metadata: Title, Subject, Description, etc. Before you add items to your collection, you will have figured out how the Dublin Core metadata schema applies to your particular data: consistency across your collection is key.
- For example, for medieval manuscripts, you can list authors of the texts under Author: but what of known scribes, who may have also intervened in the text? Are they Authors or Publishers or Contributors? Pick what makes sense and apply it consistently.
- For details on Dublin Core :
- http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/
- If you wish the Item to be visible on the public view of the site, check “Public" (under “Add Item").
- Click “Add Item" (green, right).

Once you have assembled your material, digitization work can begin. You'll need a specialized camera that can capture the colours of your manuscript, the tiny details (some not visible to the naked eye), erasures, scribal doodles, the marginal notes written by scribes and readers over the years, even bookworm damage. You'll need a cradle to support the manuscript. You'll need a conservation-friendly room, where you can control all the light sources, to make sure you take the clearest, most accurate photograph.

Let me tell you the story of the two Doomsday Books. The firsts is a Latin manuscript of the eleventh century: for taxation purposes, William the Conqueror ordered a record made of landholders and their property in much of England and parts of Wales. The book was finished in 1086 and it resides at The National Archives at Kew, London.

The second Doomsday Book was a BBC initiative, 900 years later: an attempt to build a “digital snapshot of the country,” a documentation of everyday life in communities around the United Kingdom. Over a million people contributed. 

The BBC Domesday Project was stored on adapted laser discs. Reading these discs required a state-of-the-art microcomputer, the Acorn BBC Master, customized with a specially produced laserdisc player.

Unfortunately, as the machines became obsolete, the laser discs and the data on them became unreadable. Until, roughly, 2011. After efforts by academics and technologists around the world, the BBC's own technologists, George Auckland and his Innovations Team, completed the extraction of the laser disc. The BBC Domesday Book is now available to the world at large online.

*** Data Storage
  :PROPERTIES:

- *Risky*
  - Own machine: YIKES
  - Dropbox or Google Drive: better, but not perfect

  - LOCKSS: distributed network of institutional repositories
  - Dark archives: secret, inaccessible archives (disaster recovery)

#+begin_notes 
Storing the data on your own machine is very risky. If you put it in Dropbox or Google Drive, that's better, but not perfect: what if you or a team member deletes the data by accident? Even better if you have multiple off-site backups: so if e.g. Dropbox has a security failure and your own computer is compromised, you can still get your data from the hard-drive at your parents'. Even better: GitHub (which is a platform that tracks versions of your data, where you have the history of your data and can go back to earlier versions).

If you're a research institution, you have some other, even safer options.

Your institutional repository is maintained by the library: it's a place to park your data that has sophisticated technical safeguards against data degradation.

If one institutional repository is nice, more are even better. LOCKSS is an open-source preservation system that sustains a distributed network of institutional repositories. It's like storing your backup hard-drive at your parents' and having them store their hard-drive at your house. In other words, everyone protects everyone else's data. LOCKSS stands for “lots of copies keep stuff safe.” And for additional protection, there are dark archives, for disaster recovery. These keep data secret and inaccessible until a trigger event such as a natural disaster or another kind of catastrophic data loss.

Think about the residential school system in Canada, under which about 150,000 First Nation, Inuit and Métis children were removed from their communities, forced to attend residential schools, not allowed to speak their first language, not allowed to practice native traditions. Many were starved, beaten, sexually abused. Two days ago, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne officially apologized to First Nations, Metis, and Inuit communities for the abuses of the residential school system. Part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's work has been to uncover this history. It is not recovery. It is not undoing of cultural genocide. But, and I quote the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, “A shared vision held by those affected by Indian residential schools was to create a place of learning and dialogue where the truths of their experiences were honoured and kept safe for future generations. They wanted their families, communities and all of Canada to learn from these hard lessons so they would not be repeated.” The Governing Circle of the archive must “ensure Indigenous control over the materials, ensure Indigenous control over the materials; provide guidance on policies, activities, ceremonies and protocols; and provide guidance on methods and sources for expanding the Centre's holdings and resources.” The archive does not turn back time. But it safeguards the past and, in so doing, opens up possible futures.

:PROPERTIES:

:END:

** What is Data?
#+begin_quote
Data pass themselves off as mere descriptions of a priori conditions. Rendering /observation/ (the act of creating a statistical, empirical, or subjective account or image) as if it were /the same as the phenomena observed/ collapses the critical distance between the phenomenal world and its interpretation, undoing the basis of interpretation on which humanistic knowledge production is based. We know this. But we seem ready and eager to suspend critical judgment in a rush to visualization.
#+end_quote

** Data and Capta
#+begin_quote
To overturn the assumptions that structure conventions acquired from other domains requires that we re-examine the intellectual foundations of digital humanities, putting techniques of graphical display on a foundation that is humanistic at its base. /This requires first and foremost that we reconceive all data as capta/. Differences in the etymological roots of the terms data and capta make the distinction between constructivist and realist approaches clear. /Capta/ is “taken” actively while /data/ is assumed to be a “given” able to be recorded and observed. From this distinction, a world of differences arises. Humanistic inquiry acknowledges the situated, partial, and constitutive character of knowledge production, the recognition that knowledge is constructed, /taken/, not simply given as a natural representation of pre-existing fact.

#+end_quote
** Preserving Humanistic Inquiry

#+begin_quote
The polemic I set forth here outlines several basic principles on which to proceed differently by suggesting that what is needed is not a set of applications to display humanities “data” but a new approach that uses humanities principles to constitute capta and its display. At stake, as I have said before and in many contexts, is the authority of humanistic knowledge in a culture increasingly beset by quantitative approaches that operate on claims of certainty. Bureaucracies process human activity through statistical means and when the methods grounded in empirical sciences are put at the service of the social sciences or humanities in a crudely reductive manner, basic principles of critical thought are violated, or at the very least, put too far to the side. To intervene in this ideological system, humanists, and the values they embrace and enact, must counter with conceptual tools that demonstrate humanities principles in their operation, execution, and display. 
#+end_quote

** Ambiguity as /merely irreducible/ or /constitutive/

#+begin_quote
But an important distinction needs to be clear from the outset: the task of representing ambiguity and uncertainty has to be distinguished from a second task -- that of using interpretations that arise in observer-codependence, characterized by ambiguity and uncertainty, as the basis on which a representation is constructed. This is the difference between putting many kinds of points on a map to show degrees of certainty by shades of color, degrees of crispness, transparency etc., and creating a map whose basic coordinate grid is constructed /as an effect/ of these ambiguities. In the first instance, we have a standard map with a nuanced symbol set. In the second, we create a non-standard map that expresses the constructed-ness of space.

** Spatiality

#+begin_quote
We can construct a concrete example of spatiality that parallels this example of temporality, and also depends on temporal models. For instance, imagine an open stretch of beach, relatively unconstrained and unconstructed. When a sailing ship is washed up at a certain point on the beach, not only that point, but the space around it, becomes transformed. The presence of the wreck creates a huge impact, and the space almost palpably bends, compresses, expands, and warps around it, with waves of resonance rippling outward from that point.

#+end_quote

http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/...000091/resources/images/figure14.jpg


#+begin_quote
Figure 14. 

In this example, a geographical space (a stretch of beach) is affected by a change in the state or circumstance. First we see the space mapped according to a regular Cartesian coordinate system. Then the grid is inflected by the arrival of a beached ship, around which the beach bends because the sense of each spot as relative equal is distorted by the attention that the ship commands. The space acquires one inflection after another as graffiti marks the ship, a chain link fence goes up with a police notice, footprints create a pattern in the sand, pathways for observation re-route pedestrian traffic etc. The “space” of the beach is transformed physically and in terms of attention getting and effect so that it is no longer a set of equal and neutral elements of a rational spatial system, but one that must be expressed with graphical distortions that show these inflections.

"This figure is James Hemings, Thomas Jefferson's enslaved personal chef (and Sally Hemings's older brother). When Jefferson was appointed Ambassador to France, he took Hemings with him to Paris, and there apprenticed him to the chef of a prince. Through the few archival records that relate to Hemings, we also know, for instance, that while in Paris, Hemings hired his own tutor and learned to speak fluent French. And here's another thing Hemings learned in Paris: what it might mean to be free. [...]

It is then a striking instantiation of archival silence that when you perform a "Name" search for a person named James Hemings in the /The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Digital Edition/, you get no results---because Hemings, in spite of his ability to read and write in two languages--because of his status as a slave--was not a person to whom Jefferson ever wrote, or from whom Jefferson received letters."

"Who are those dots? Each individual had a profile, age, size, health, economic potential, family and social roles. [...] But what if we take the rate of deaths, their frequency, and chart that on a temporal axis inflected by increasing panic. Then give a graphical expression to the shape of the terrain, that urban streetscape, as it is redrawn to express the emotional landscape. Then imagine drawing this same streetscape from the point of view of a mother of six young children, a recent widow, a small child, or an elderly man whose son has just died" (Drucker, “[[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html][Humanities Approaches]]").

** Some Rules of Thumb

- in general, creative relationships to data/capta are *more* work than rigourous but straightforward quantitative analysis
- they require familiarity both *both* humanities concepts *and* the underlying technologies
- humaniites tools, though, try to *lower the barrier to entry* and so *often hide the underlying technology*.
- this lets you *play* with visualization but is rarely sufficient to bring *rela insights* and *creative accomplishments*

- Digital Humanities: A History
- Anatomy of DH Projects
- Archives: Endangered, Lost, Banned, Censored Books (visit to Thomas Fischer Rare Book Library)
- How to Read with DH Data: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Tell Stories, Play Games
- Interfaces, Users, and Usability
- Communities, Libraries, and Possible Futures

** Learning Goals
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: learning-goals
  :style: page-break-before:always; 
  :END:

- Digital Humanities (DH) is a discipline at the intersections of the humanities with computing.
- Digital humanists analyze languages through digital text collections; build digital archives of forbidden books; resurrect historical cities through digital maps; or construct video games to study literature.
- This year the course focuses on endangered books: fragile, hidden, censored, forbidden. We speak to scholars who build archives of forbidden literature. We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. We study rare books' histories through digital exhibits.
- By the end of the course, you will have mastered concepts and technologies you can use in future courses and workplaces: data visualization, data analysis, and digital exhibit platforms. And you will learn how our stories and cultural conversations work and shapeshift through digital environments.

** By the end of the course:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: by-the-end-of-the-course
  :style: page-break-before:always; 
  :END:

- You will be able to describe the history and intellectual landscape of the digital humanities, including central concepts, debates, digital tools and platforms current in the discipline.
- You will be able to analyze digital humanities research projects across a variety of humanities disciplines
- You will have developed critical thinking and a set of best practices around data modeling, datasets, project design and management, and research data management
- You will have analyzed and built visualizations and digital maps
- You will have researched and authored your own digital exhibit

It may help you to see a few more tags. Here is a slightly more complex example, with a more completely marked-up selection of the poem. I have *not* annotated this example, but it showcases a few more features of the systems we're learning.  In particular, this example introduces:
- [[https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp][more complex colors]]
- [[https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp][the "a" or hyperlink tag]]
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10395488/how-to-concat-a-string-to-xslvalue-of-select][curly braces as a shortcut for xpaths]]
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11744465/xpath-difference-between-node-and-text][the somewhat confusing xpath test "node"]], which sometimes makes sense to use when "current()" doesn't produce the effect you want.
