- Every exportable entry must have the ~EXPORT_FILE_NAME~ property set before export.
- I should write some code to shunt this stuff to ox-huveal instead of ox-hugo.  This is a project for another time.
- interestingly, I probably don't want to set ox-hugo-auto-export-on-save for this file, because my most urgent need is going to be to export local reveal files.  Exporting to hugo -- or huveal if I can figure that out -- will be difficult.
- so, maybe I want to repurpose some of the auto-export code for use with my lectures!

#+begin_notes
Digital archives provide access to material that may be housed far from a scholar's physical location. Ten years ago, I had to travel to the British Library to work with their medieval manuscripts. (Incidentally, I still have the sketches I made of their illumination. In pencil, because you can't take pens into the reading room.) I got to handle a fourteenth-century manuscript, its parchment pages as supple, its illuminations as vivid as the day the book was scribed. I sat in the special collections library for seven hours. I looked at the illuminations; I handled the parchment, noting the differences between hair side and flesh side (parchment is made of animal skin, so you can see which side faced the outside and which faced the inside of the animal). For days, my hands smelled like goat.

Now, I am able to access the images in the manuscript online---anytime, from my office at UofT. I can compare the images to other manuscripts of the Book of John Mandeville. I can study them, annotate them, put them in Powerpoints, and reference them robustly in scholarly arguments.

Humanities data has depth in small universes. Our material has the capacity to unfold inwards, as it were, to disclose layer upon layer of insights and connections, within a comparatively tiny amount of data--almost an inverse matryoshka, as it were, where each inner doll is bigger and more complex than the one encasing it.

- Data visualization: giving visual forms to data in order to explore and discern patterns, gain or illustrate insights
- Digital archives: digital (or digitized) collections of primary documents about a place or a community; more broadly, collections of primary documents, e.g. manuscripts, books, letters, photographs, etc.
- Digital mapping: plotting historical or literary data (urban economy, pilgrim routes, artifacts found at different archaeological sites, a character's journey in a book) onto a modern, historical, or imaginary map
- Augmented/virtual reality: using computing to overlay virtual elements onto real landscapes (AR), or using computing tech to simulate an immersive, interactive, three-dimensional virtual environment
- 3D printing: turning a digital model into a real object through additive manufacturing (delicate layering of plastic via 3D printer machine)

We would like to acknowledge this sacred land on which the University of Toronto operates. It has been a site of human activity for 15,000 years. This land is the territory of the Huron-Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. The territory was the subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Iroquois Confederacy and Confederacy of the Ojibwe and allied nations to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. Today, the meeting place of Toronto is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work in the community, on this territory.

[E]ven doorknobs have politics in that they may be round, requiring a human hand to turn them, or shaped as levers, such that a person with a prosthetic limb or an armload of groceries with one free elbow can still successfully use them. This is more than simply a matter of utility. Both designs are political in that they presume and construct different kinds of worlds, with the round doorknob presuming a world in which everyone’s bodies are the same, and in which hands with opposable thumbs and sufficient grip strength are always available (Galey, Alan, and Stan Ruecker. “How a Prototype Argues." /Literary and Linguistic Computing/ 25.4 (2010): 405-24.

It would be possible to enumerate all of the filmic conventions that recall the conventions of melodrama. Is there a villain? Is there a heroine? Are good and evil depicted in stark, black-and-white terms? You could even build a dataset like this and use it to show how film changed over time.
| Title                 | Year | Virtuous Heroine | Cruel Villain | Terrible evil | Heroine in peril | Broad gestures |
| The Lonedale Operator | 1911 | x                | x             | x             | x                | x              |

*** Add an Item: Dublin Core Metadata

- In the Item's fields, enter the metadata: Title, Subject, Description, etc. Before you add items to your collection, you will have figured out how the Dublin Core metadata schema applies to your particular data: consistency across your collection is key.
- For example, for medieval manuscripts, you can list authors of the texts under Author: but what of known scribes, who may have also intervened in the text? Are they Authors or Publishers or Contributors? Pick what makes sense and apply it consistently.
- For details on Dublin Core :
- http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/
- If you wish the Item to be visible on the public view of the site, check “Public" (under “Add Item").
- Click “Add Item" (green, right).

- Creator;
- Source (can be e.g. manuscript or book or collection);
- Publisher;
- Date;
- Rights (i.e. who owns copyright -- language here will vary strongly depending on institution the items come from, and that is not an error on the students' part);
- Format material, e.g. bronze, parchment, etc.);

"This figure is James Hemings, Thomas Jefferson's enslaved personal chef (and Sally Hemings's older brother). When Jefferson was appointed Ambassador to France, he took Hemings with him to Paris, and there apprenticed him to the chef of a prince. Through the few archival records that relate to Hemings, we also know, for instance, that while in Paris, Hemings hired his own tutor and learned to speak fluent French. And here's another thing Hemings learned in Paris: what it might mean to be free. [...]

It is then a striking instantiation of archival silence that when you perform a "Name" search for a person named James Hemings in the /The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Digital Edition/, you get no results---because Hemings, in spite of his ability to read and write in two languages--because of his status as a slave--was not a person to whom Jefferson ever wrote, or from whom Jefferson received letters."

"Who are those dots? Each individual had a profile, age, size, health, economic potential, family and social roles.

Then give a graphical expression to the shape of the terrain, that urban streetscape, as it is redrawn to express the emotional landscape. Then imagine drawing this same streetscape from the point of view of a mother of six young children, a recent widow, a small child, or an elderly man whose son has just died" (Drucker, “[[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html][Humanities Approaches]]").

** Some Rules of Thumb

- in general, creative relationships to data/capta are *more* work than rigourous but straightforward quantitative analysis
- they require familiarity both *both* humanities concepts *and* the underlying technologies
- humaniites tools, though, try to *lower the barrier to entry* and so *often hide the underlying technology*.
- this lets you *play* with visualization but is rarely sufficient to bring *rela insights* and *creative accomplishments*

Once you have assembled your material, digitization work can begin. You'll need a specialized camera that can capture the colours of your manuscript, the tiny details (some not visible to the naked eye), erasures, scribal doodles, the marginal notes written by scribes and readers over the years, even bookworm damage. You'll need a cradle to support the manuscript. You'll need a conservation-friendly room, where you can control all the light sources, to make sure you take the clearest, most accurate photograph.

Let me tell you the story of the two Doomsday Books. The firsts is a Latin manuscript of the eleventh century: for taxation purposes, William the Conqueror ordered a record made of landholders and their property in much of England and parts of Wales. The book was finished in 1086 and it resides at The National Archives at Kew, London.

The second Doomsday Book was a BBC initiative, 900 years later: an attempt to build a “digital snapshot of the country,” a documentation of everyday life in communities around the United Kingdom. Over a million people contributed. 

The BBC Domesday Project was stored on adapted laser discs. Reading these discs required a state-of-the-art microcomputer, the Acorn BBC Master, customized with a specially produced laserdisc player.


#+end_notes


** Domesday Book
Unfortunately, as the machines became obsolete, the laser discs and the data on them became unreadable. Until, roughly, 2011. After efforts by academics and technologists around the world, the BBC's own technologists, George Auckland and his Innovations Team, completed the extraction of the laser disc. The BBC Domesday Book is now available to the world at large online.


** Data Loss and Digital Archives: Storage, Loss, Preservation


*** Data Storage
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: data-storage
  :style: page-break-before:always; 
  :END:

- *Risky*
  - Own machine: YIKES
  - Dropbox or Google Drive: better, but not perfect

- *Safer*
  - Multiple backups off-site
  - GitHub (version control)
  - Institutional repository (i.e. the library) with technical safeguards against data degradation
  - LOCKSS: distributed network of institutional repositories
  - Dark archives: secret, inaccessible archives (disaster recovery)

#+begin_notes 
Storing the data on your own machine is very risky. If you put it in Dropbox or Google Drive, that's better, but not perfect: what if you or a team member deletes the data by accident? Even better if you have multiple off-site backups: so if e.g. Dropbox has a security failure and your own computer is compromised, you can still get your data from the hard-drive at your parents'. Even better: GitHub (which is a platform that tracks versions of your data, where you have the history of your data and can go back to earlier versions).

If you're a research institution, you have some other, even safer options.

Your institutional repository is maintained by the library: it's a place to park your data that has sophisticated technical safeguards against data degradation.

If one institutional repository is nice, more are even better. LOCKSS is an open-source preservation system that sustains a distributed network of institutional repositories. It's like storing your backup hard-drive at your parents' and having them store their hard-drive at your house. In other words, everyone protects everyone else's data. LOCKSS stands for “lots of copies keep stuff safe.” And for additional protection, there are dark archives, for disaster recovery. These keep data secret and inaccessible until a trigger event such as a natural disaster or another kind of catastrophic data loss.

- *Emulation*
  - In a new, stable software platform, recreating the---now obsolete---original environment of a digital object
  - Good for complicated digital objects (software)
  - Example: old arcade video games.

Think about the residential school system in Canada, under which about 150,000 First Nation, Inuit and Métis children were removed from their communities, forced to attend residential schools, not allowed to speak their first language, not allowed to practice native traditions. Many were starved, beaten, sexually abused. Two days ago, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne officially apologized to First Nations, Metis, and Inuit communities for the abuses of the residential school system. Part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's work has been to uncover this history. It is not recovery. It is not undoing of cultural genocide. But, and I quote the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, “A shared vision held by those affected by Indian residential schools was to create a place of learning and dialogue where the truths of their experiences were honoured and kept safe for future generations. They wanted their families, communities and all of Canada to learn from these hard lessons so they would not be repeated.” The Governing Circle of the archive must “ensure Indigenous control over the materials, ensure Indigenous control over the materials; provide guidance on policies, activities, ceremonies and protocols; and provide guidance on methods and sources for expanding the Centre's holdings and resources.” The archive does not turn back time. But it safeguards the past and, in so doing, opens up possible futures.

- Digital Humanities (DH) is a discipline at the intersections of the humanities with computing.
- Digital humanists analyze languages through digital text collections; build digital archives of forbidden books; resurrect historical cities through digital maps; or construct video games to study literature.
- This year the course focuses on endangered books: fragile, hidden, censored, forbidden. We speak to scholars who build archives of forbidden literature. We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. We study rare books' histories through digital exhibits.
- By the end of the course, you will have mastered concepts and technologies you can use in future courses and workplaces: data visualization, data analysis, and digital exhibit platforms. And you will learn how our stories and cultural conversations work and shapeshift through digital environments.

** By the end of the course:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: by-the-end-of-the-course
