      <description>## Overview {#overview} In this assignment, you get to tell the story of a banned book you have seen in person, either from the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library or from our list. You will create a website that features a digital collection and exhibit about that book, using the free, open-source content management platform Omeka. Like a good museum curator, you will bring together a gallery of exciting pictures, and you will guide your visitors through that gallery through a well-researched, interesting narrative about your book.</description>
