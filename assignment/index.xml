      <description>In this assignment, you will encode parts of a thousand-year-old poem using a markup language, display the marked-up text in a web browser using a computational translator, and discuss this exercise using the idea of deformance as a guide. This handout should contain everything you need to complete the assignment, but please use the discussion forum to ask any technical (or other!) questions.
The Poem: “The Ruin” (from the tenth century Exeter Book), translated by Sian Echard, silently emended &amp;ldquo;The Ruin&amp;rdquo; was likely written in the 8th or 9th century, and recorded in the Exeter Book in the 10th century.</description>

      <description>Overview In this assignment, you get to tell the story of a banned book you have seen in person, either from the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library or from our list.
You will create a website that features a digital collection and exhibit about that book, using the free, open-source content management platform Omeka. Like a good museum curator, you will bring together a gallery of exciting pictures, and you will guide your visitors through that gallery through a well-researched, interesting narrative about your book.</description>
