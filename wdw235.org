* Course Description

   :END:

Digital Humanities (DH) is a discipline at the intersections of the humanities with computing.  DH studies human culture -- art, literature, history, geography, religion -- through computational tools and methodologies; and, in turn, DH studies digital artifacts through humanist lenses, as complex cultural objects shaped by wider social, political, and philosophical concerns. Digital humanists [[http://www.doe.utoronto.ca][analyze languages through digital text collections]]; [[https://samizdat.library.utoronto.ca/][build digital archives of forbidden books]]; [[http://sites.utm.utoronto.ca/gillespie/content/welcome-book-fame][construct video games to study literature]]; or [[https://decima-map.net/][resurrect historical cities through digital maps]].

This year the course focuses on endangered books: /fragile, hidden, censored, forbidden/. We speak to scholars who build archives of forbidden literature. We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. We study rare books' histories through digital exhibits. By the end of the course, you will have mastered concepts and technologies you can use in future courses and workplaces:  text encoding and data visualization, data analysis and digital exhibit platforms. And you will learn how our stories and cultural conversations work and shapeshift through digital environments.

* Learning Goals
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: learning-goals
   :END:

By the end of the course:

- You will be able to describe the history and intellectual landscape of the digital humanities, including the central concepts, debates, projects, and digital tools current in the discipline.
- You will have developed a set of best practices around datasets, project design and management, and data curation.
- You will have analyzed data and digital artifacts as complex cultural objects, shaped by, and shaping, how we live, think, and know.

Through hands-on workshops:

- You will experiment with text encoding, quantitative text analysis, text-based videogames, and Twitter bots as tools of scholarly research
- You will create and analyze data visualizations
- You will research and author your own digital exhibit

* Course Readings & Technologies
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: course-readings-technologies
   :END:

Course readings will be available via the course Quercus site each week. You are responsible for checking the Quercus site and ensuring you receive course announcements posted via Quercus.

All technologies in this course are free and open-source. You will need access to a working computer to complete the work for this course.

* How This Course Works
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: how-this-course-works
   :END:

Each week we have three hours of class:

- Two hours of lecture and discussion (classroom time);
- One hour of hands-on workshops and discussion (lab time).

Much of your course work will be done in class, in facilitated environments and hands-on workshops. Given the fast pace and praxis-oriented environment, you must come to class on time, all the time: it is all too easy, otherwise, to get lost. If this poses a problem, please let me know as soon as possible.

* Accessibility

* Assignments
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: assignments
   :END:

*Reflection Portfolio*

You are responsible for writing three reflections in this course. Reflections include in-class digital artifacts as well as discussion of course readings. You will work on reflections in class as well as outside class, and you will hand them in via Quercus. They need not be perfect, just done. 400-500 words maximum.

*DH Project Profile*

Your first assignment is to profile a Digital Humanities project, analyzing its research aims, its form and content, its interface, technologies, and intended audience. 500-700 words. You will select the project from a sign-up list available via our course site.

*Workshops*

Every week, you are also responsible for coming to the lab and undertaking the project or field trip of the week in a facilitated environment. This is where you can explore, experiment, fail creatively: all I require is *engaged participation---that is, you come to class, do the hands-on computer work, ask questions, and engage in class discussion*.

*Book Story*

Your major assignment in this course is to tell the story of a banned, challenged, or endangered book through a digital exhibit.

* Contact
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: contact
   :END:

I love hearing from you! *The best way to contact me is to talk to me in person in office hours.* I also answer emails at [[mailto:alexandra.bolintineanu@utoronto.ca][alexandra.bolintineanu@utoronto.ca]] within 48 hours or fewer on business days. However, I do not answer email after 5:00 p.m. or on weekends, and I do not expect you to do so, either. Please email me as soon as possible to make sure you receive your answers in good time.

* Due Dates & Late Penalties
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: due-dates-late-penalties
   :END:

*Assignments*: Assignments are due at the beginning of each class. Late assignments will be penalized two percentage points per day unless you have prior permission from the instructor in writing (email). (Of course, late penalties do not apply when the lateness was caused by illness, bereavement, religious observances, or other serious circumstances outside students' control.)

*Weekly Responses (Blog Posts)*: Blog posts about one class are due at the beginning of the following class. If you are late one week, you need to blog about the following week.

*Lab Work*: If you miss a class, you are responsible for catching up with the work and will not receive credit for that class. (Of course, I will not penalize you if your absence is caused by illness, bereavement, religious observances, or other serious circumstances outside students' control.)

*Missed Test*: If you miss the term test, you will receive a make-up opportunity only on medical or compassionate grounds. You must contact me no later than one week after the missed test to request consideration for a make-up test.

*Documentation needed for extensions/makeup test:* As a matter of fairness to all students, you may be required to support any request for extensions or makeup test with supporting documentation. For medical issues, documentation consists of UofT's [[http://www.illnessverification.utoronto.ca/getattachment/index/Verification-of-Illness-or-Injury-form-Jan-22-2013.pdf.aspx][Verification of Student Illness or Injury form]]. For non-medical issues, documentation consists of a note from the student's College Registrar, social worker, clergy etc. Non-medical notes must contain the same information requested on the “UofT's [[http://www.illnessverification.utoronto.ca/getattachment/index/Verification-of-Illness-or-Injury-form-Jan-22-2013.pdf.aspx][Verification of Student Illness or Injury form]].

*Re-marking*: The deadline for requesting a re-marking is two weeks from the date the term work was made available for pickup. Unfortunately, I am unable to accept late re-marking requests.

* Academic Integrity
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: academic-integrity
   :END:

In this course, you will work with texts, objects, and digital artifacts. As you navigate the world of digital cultural heritage and write for a wider public, you are allowed (indeed, encouraged!) to use the work of others -- but you must carefully and conscientiously acknowledge your sources, give credit where credit is due, and respect the University of Toronto's expectations of academic integrity ([[http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/osai/The-rules/what-is-academic-misconduct]]).

|                  |           | In facilitated workshops, we turn to data visualization of humanities materials, using Jane Austen's /Lady Susan/ for experimentation (Voyant, Palladio, Cytoscape, Tableau: text and corpus work, network graphs, mapping, annotation). Then we analyze the American Library Association's data on banned books and discuss how we might model, interpret, question, and visualize this data.                                                                                                           |                                             |
