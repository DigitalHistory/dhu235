	"content": "Your first assignment is to profile a Digital Humanities project, analyzing its research aims, its form and content, its interface, technologies, and intended audience. You will learn how to navigate Digital Humanities projects, how to identify and evaluate different aspects of such projects, and how to analyze the kinds of knowledge and digital artifacts generated by DH projects. Write-up: 500 words plus screenshots.\nYou may select any project you like from the syllabus or from one of the pages below:\n https://digitalhumanities.duke.edu/all-projects (please start here) https://dhcommons.org/projects https://eadh.org/projects http://digitalhumanities.unc.edu/resources/projects/  This project profile is not an essay; it is a short, 1-2 page report. You do not need to write a formal introduction, thesis, argument, or conclusion. You should only report on your observations, using the questions below as categories of analysis, each with its own heading. Not all categories and questions apply to all projects, so do not feel obligated to respond to all of them. Your project profile will be evaluated for accuracy, clarity, detail, quality of analysis, and insight.\n Project: What is the name of the project? Who are its primary authors?\n Topic: What is the project about? (Examples: What topic and historical period does it focus on? What texts or art works or other material does it collect, explain, map, or analyze? What questions is the project seeking to answer?)\n People \u0026amp; Institutions: Who is the project leader? Who are their collaborators? What is the institution involved in the project\u0026rsquo;s development? What are the granting bodies funding the projects? Is credit given to individual contributors? To what extent?\n Presentation \u0026amp; User Experience: What is the “digital artifact” through which this project communicates its findings? A book? A game? A map? An edition? An archive? A tool? Another type of digital artifact?\nAs a user external to the project, what steps did you take to explore the project? Can you understand how to read the project\u0026rsquo;s data or how to use the tools it is building? As you explore the project, what do you find easy? What do you find difficult? What do you like? What do you dislike? Document your experience with screenshots, please (firefox\u0026rsquo;s screenshot tool makes this very easy).\nDoes this project provide access to users with e.g. limited bandwidth, minimal computing (e.g. smartphones instead of laptops), vision or hearing or tactile impairment?\n Data: What data does the project generate? What data format(s): text files, pdf files, digital images, databases, Excel or .csv files? Does the project provide narrative context for its data (that is, does it clearly explain what its data means and why it matters, for readers not familiar with the project)? Is access to project data open, subscription-only, or under a specific licence? May other scholars download the project\u0026rsquo;s data?\n Technologies: What technologies (encoding formats, digital publication platforms, software) are used in this project or built as part of this project? Are these technologies open-source, open-access?\n Audience: Who is the intended audience for this project? That is, does this project primarily speak to laypeople? Scholars? Specialists? How can you tell?\n Limitations: Does the project make note of any limitations in its work, any gaps or uncertainties in its data? Can you find limitations in its work\u0026mdash;that is, gaps between its stated goals and its results?\n  This assignment is based on the DMP Tool, the U of T DH Census Profile tool, and Kristen Mapes\u0026rsquo; DH Project Critique assignment.\n"

I got to handle a fourteenth-century manuscript, its parchment pages as supple, its illuminations as vivid as the day the book was scribed. I sat in the special collections library for seven hours.

	"content": " Course Details    Instructor Matt Price     Course Hours MW 10-1   Office Hours MW 1-2 (Locate TBA)   Email matt.price@utoronto.ca (weekdays 9-5, 48h turnaround)    Course Description Digital Humanities (DH) is a discipline at the intersections of the humanities with computing. DH studies human culture \u0026ndash; art, literature, history, geography, religion \u0026ndash; through computational tools and methodologies; and, in turn, DH studies digital artifacts through humanist lenses, as complex cultural objects shaped by wider social, political, and philosophical concerns. Digital humanists analyze languages through digital text collections; build digital archives of forbidden books; construct video games to study literature; or resurrect historical cities through digital maps.\nThis summer, as in Fall 2018, the course focuses on endangered books: fragile, hidden, censored, forbidden. We speak to scholars who build archives of forbidden literature. We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. We study rare books\u0026rsquo; histories through digital exhibits. By the end of the course, you will have mastered concepts and technologies you can use in future courses and workplaces: text encoding and data visualization, data analysis and digital exhibit platforms. And you will learn how our stories and cultural conversations work and shapeshift through digital environments.\nLearning Goals By the end of the course:\n You will be able to describe the history and intellectual landscape of the digital humanities, including the central concepts, debates, projects, and digital tools current in the discipline. You will have developed a set of best practices around datasets, project design and management, and data curation. You will have analyzed data and digital artifacts as complex cultural objects, shaped by, and shaping, how we live, think, and know.  Through hands-on workshops:\n You will experiment with text encoding, quantitative text analysis, and text-based videogames as tools of scholarly research You will create and analyze data visualizations You will research and author your own digital exhibit  Course Readings \u0026amp; Technologies Course readings will be available either as links in the syllabus or via the course Quercus site each week. You are responsible for checking the Quercus site and ensuring you receive course announcements posted via Quercus.\nAll technologies used in this course are open-source or, in rare cases, licensed for use by U of T students. You will need access to a working computer to complete the work for this course.\nHow This Course Works Each week we have three hours of class, usually divided approximately as below:\n Two hours of lecture and discussion (classroom time); One hour of hands-on workshops and discussion (lab time).  Much of your course work will be done in class, in facilitated environments and hands-on workshops. Given the fast pace and praxis-oriented environment, you must come to class on time, all the time: it is all too easy, otherwise, to get lost. If this poses a problem, please let me know as soon as possible.\nAccessibility Students with diverse learning styles and needs are more than welcome in this course. Please feel free to approach me or Accessibility Services so we can assist you in achieving academic success in this course.\nSee A\u0026amp;S Accessibility Website for more details on the Accessibility policy.\nGrading Scheme    Assignment % Due Date     Participation 15 All semester; alternatives.

Assignments Reflection Portfolio You are responsible for writing three reflections in this course. Reflections include in-class digital artifacts as well as discussion of course readings. You will work on reflections in class as well as outside class, and you will hand them in via Quercus. They need not be perfect, just done. 400-500 words maximum.\nDH Project Profile Your first assignment is to profile a Digital Humanities project, analyzing its research aims, its form and content, its interface, technologies, and intended audience. 500-700 words. You will select the project from a sign-up list available via our course site.\nWorkshops Every week, you are also responsible for coming to the lab and undertaking the project or field trip of the week in a facilitated environment. This is where you can explore, experiment, fail creatively: all I require is engaged participation\u0026mdash;that is, you come to class, do the hands-on computer work, ask questions, and engage in class discussion.\nBook Project Your major assignment in this course is to tell the story of a banned, challenged, or endangered book through a digital exhibit.\nContact I love hearing from you! The best way to contact me is to talk to me in person in office hours. I also answer emails at matt.price@utoronto.ca within 48 hours or fewer on business days. However, I do not answer email after 5:00 p.m. or on weekends, and I do not expect you to do so, either. Please email me as soon as possible to make sure you receive your answers in good time.\nDue Dates \u0026amp; Late Penalties  Assignments Assignments are due at the beginning of each class. Late assignments will be penalized three percentage points per day unless you have prior permission from the instructor in writing (email). (Of course, late penalties do not apply when the lateness was caused by illness, bereavement, or other serious circumstances outside students\u0026rsquo; control. For religious observances, please notify instructor before the due date.) Lab Work If you miss a class, you are responsible for catching up with the work and will not receive credit for that class. (Of course, I will not penalize you if your absence is caused by illness, bereavement, religious observances, or other serious circumstances outside students\u0026rsquo; control.) Documentation needed for extensions As a matter of fairness to all students, you may be required to support any request for extensions or makeup test with supporting documentation. For medical issues, documentation consists of UofT\u0026rsquo;s Verification of Student Illness or Injury form. For non-medical issues, documentation consists of a note from the student\u0026rsquo;s College Registrar, social worker, clergy etc. Non-medical notes must contain the same information requested on U of T\u0026rsquo;s Verification of Student Illness or Injury form. Re-marking The deadline for requesting a re-marking is one week from the date the term work was made available for pickup. Unfortunately, I am unable to accept late re-marking requests.  Academic Integrity In this course, you will work with texts, objects, and digital artifacts. As you navigate the world of digital cultural heritage and write for a wider public, you are allowed (indeed, encouraged!) to use the work of others \u0026ndash; but you must carefully and conscientiously acknowledge your sources, give credit where credit is due, and respect the University of Toronto\u0026rsquo;s expectations of academic integrity.\nAcknowledgments This syllabus was originally written by Alexandra Bolintineanu, and draws on both Kristen Mapes\u0026rsquo; Introduction to Digital Humanities, AL285 and on Miriam Posner\u0026rsquo;s DH101: Introduction to Digital Humanities Fall 2014, UCLA.\nCourse Overview (Subject to Change) 1 (May. 06) Introduction to Digital Humanities What is “Digital Humanities”? We discuss the range of projects, activities, and concerns of this growing field, and collaboratively survey representative projects from around the world. We discuss DH in relation to the theme of the course, banned books.\nTool Workshop: Twine  How do digital media change possibilities for humanists to express themselves and craft persuasive arguments? We experiment via a popular game-design tool.  2 (May. 08) The Anatomy of DH Projects We discuss the components of digital humanities projects—data, code, tools, platforms, standards and communities of practice—as they manifest across a gallery of projects, living or dead. We investigate success, failure, and sustainability in DH projects. We collaboratively analyze two DH projects, peering “under the hood” of their technical framework and examining their research questions, digital artifacts, user experiences and intended audiences, and disciplinary implications.\nReadings and Discussion:  Miriam Posner, “How Did They Make That?” (2013) Alan Galey \u0026amp; Stan Ruecker, “How a Prototype Argues” (2010) (in-class discussion)  Reflection Handed Out: DH Project Profile Due May 13\n3 (May. 13) Endangered Knowledge 1: Rare Books \u0026amp; Digital Archives The first part of class is devoted to understanding the main course assignment, with some lecture material about endangered knowledge\nTools Workshop: Omeka A very brief intro to Omeka, the framework we\u0026rsquo;ll use to build your class projects.\nClass Outing: Banned and Censored Books We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library under the guidance of Tim Stinson, Cataloguer and Reference Librarian at the Library, and are introduced to the candidate books for your final projects.\nPlease Note: due to an unfortunate scheduling difficulty, our only window for this visit is 12:00-1:30 today. I am hopeful that everyone in the class can stay for this entire period.\n4 (May. 15) Digital Texts: Reading and Writing Endangered ‘book’: oral poetry, cultural memory\n Kinds of danger, types of responses Using digital methods to discover and highlight new understanding of literary texts  Readings \u0026amp; Discussion:  Lisa Samuels and Jerome J.
