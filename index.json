	"content": "Overview In this assignment, you get to tell the story of a banned book you have seen in person, either from the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library or from our list.\nYou will create a website that features a digital collection and exhibit about that book, using the free, open-source content management platform Omeka. Like a good museum curator, you will bring together a gallery of exciting pictures, and you will guide your visitors through that gallery through a well-researched, interesting narrative about your book.\n  Your digital collection will catalogue evidence about your book: photographs of the book itself (title page, illustrations, marginal annotations, damage, other interesting features); images of related books from other museums; manuscript illuminations; other relevant multimedia. Each object of your digital collection will be described systematically, as books are described in a library catalogue.\n  Your exhibit will be a guided tour about your book and the circumstances under which it was banned.\n  You will use some digital technology as part of this assignment.\n  This is a scaffolded assignment: that is, you will produce several components at each stage, and each component builds on the ones before it\u0026ndash; like LEGO, except you get to build your own bricks.\nLearning Goals By the end of this learning module, you will have learned:\n  How to understand your book\u0026rsquo;s significance, history, and meaning, in its historical context;\n  How to think about the transmission and attempted restriction of knowledge in different technological platforms (manuscripts, printed books, digital media)\n  How to build an exhibit around objects and their history;\n  What metadata is, and why metadata matters\n  What Omeka is, and what content management systems are\n  How to create your own Omeka site: building items, creating digital collections and building exhibits featuring scholarly materials\n  What You Hand In:   A proposal describing, in 200 words or fewer, the object whose story you plan to tell: what it is; why it was banned, by whom, and in what historical context; and how you plan to shape your exhibit. Due 06/05\n  An annotated bibliography (http://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/types-of-writing/annotated-bibliography/) that contains: links to and descriptions of at least 3 things for your collection; references to and summaries of at least 3 scholarly sources (scholarly print books, scholarly journal articles, scholarly encyclopedia entries). Due 06/17\n  A complete digital exhibit website that contains your collection of objects and a narrative about that collection. For reference, a former student\u0026rsquo;s UofT Library Research Prize-winning example of such a digital exhibit is d:escribed in detail here Jaya Thirugnanasampanthan\u0026rsquo;s exhibit on Thirteen Reasons Why\u0026lsquo;s banning in the U.S. (you will have to click through a bit to find a link to a walkthrough of the site).\n  Proposal 100-200 words: describe your book and the structure of your exhibit.\nSample Proposal\n   Example Discussion     My exhibit focuses on Ana Blandiana\u0026rsquo;s Întâmplări de pe strada mea One sentence identifying your object and   (‘Events From My Street\u0026rsquo;), a Romanian children\u0026rsquo;s book, which was banned its place/time of origin.   in Romania during the Ceaușescu regime.        I will discuss this book from the following points of view: An overview of your exhibit: its sections    and some of its objects.       Book I will describe the book itself, published in 1988 and banned Describe the book itself.   shortly afterwards.                    Ban or Challenge. I discuss why the book was scrutinized by the You will probably have less to say in your   Communist regime. Some items here include: photos of the pages with the proposal: that is FINE. Indicate who banned   poem “A star on my street,” a poem about a boastful kitten which was the bool, and why, and how your exhibit will   interpreted as a criticism of the dictator Ceausescu and caused the show this.   book to be scrutinized by the Securitate (the secret police); archival    photos of schoolchildren forced to celebrate Ceausescu; and children\u0026rsquo;s    textbooks featuring first-page photographs of Ceausescu. These    artifacts show how official culture sought to frame and control the    experience and knowledge of childhood.        Conclusion. I discuss children\u0026rsquo;s literature in Communist Romania as    a space in which writers dared to experiment, because children\u0026rsquo;s books    allowed writers to say uncomfortable things in playful or disguised    ways.            I contrast this with the ways the contemporary school system, in their    censorship of e.g. history books, competed to shape children\u0026rsquo;s worlds    and knowledge, selecting the literature and history curriculum to    reflect the ideology of the totalitarian government.         Collection 5 Items or more, to be described with Dublin Core metadata, including photos of your book:\nThe collection is a set of at least 5 items that document your book and the context in which it was banned. Photographs of the book should be taken by yourself; the other photographs, you may find on museum websites and cite properly.\nSome examples of objects that shed light on your book and the context in which your book was banned:\n  If you are studying a book banned in Nazi Germany, find digitized archival photographs documenting e.g. book burnings in Nazi Germany;\n  If you are studying a book banned by the Catholic Church, photograph the Index;\n  If you are studying, say, Darwin\u0026rsquo;s Origin of Species, you can document its impact with photos of 19thcentury newspaper articles about it\u0026hellip;or with 21stcentury newspaper articles on the controversy around the depiction and teaching of evolution vs. creationism in U.S. schools\n  If you are studying a science book, you can illustrate the science of the day with museum pictures of relevant scientific instruments (microscopes, telescopes);\n  If you are studying a book of saints\u0026rsquo; lives (banned by Protestants) or a theological work (attacking the Catholic Church), you may look for contemporary images of e.g. book burnings, anti-Papal posters, etc.\n  Exhibit In every exhibit, at least four sections are mandatory: Introduction; Book; Context; and Insights. You may include other sections if needed.\nIntroduction This section is a summary of your exhibit, indicating what your book is, when it was banned, and why. 100-150 words. (A cleaned-up version of your proposal.)\nBook In this section, you describe your book and its author. What is its title? Who is its author? In detail and in your own words, summarize what the book is about. (size; shape; damage; marginal annotations, if any; illustrations, if any; other distinguishing marks, if any.) Your items in this section can be different photos of your book. Include as much descriptive detail as you can.\nContext In this section, you describe the social and historical context of your book: that is, the book\u0026rsquo;s time, place, and purpose. When and where was it written? What text technologies were involved in its creation? To what effect? Who was its intended audience? Why is the book in danger? If it is a banned or censored book, then who banned or challenged the book, and why? How was this censorship or challenge enforced? Your exhibit items can include maps, photographs of people reading the book, photographs of people destroying the book, recordings, etc.\nInsights What insights (specific to your book\u0026mdash;not a general conclusion that almost any other banned or endangered book could illustrate) into text technologies and the transmission of knowledge would you like your viewer to draw from your exhibit?\nMore specifically: how do the cultural and technical conditions in which the book was produced affect its endangerment and its afterlife? And how does the digital exhibit help you reflect on the text culture of your book?\nDraw on the scholarly readings of this course, from Alan Liu to Bethany Nowviskie, to discuss the “new media encounter” moment between the endangered book and your presentation of it in a digital medium. (Some things to think about: textual stability, deformance, sustainability, new media encounters, deep time\u0026hellip;)\nWorks Cited This section contains resources\u0026mdash;scholarly articles or museum articles or books\u0026mdash;on which your exhibit draws. You may use any scholarly citation style you like, as long as you are consistent.\nExample:\nGogata, Cristina. “Parallel Libraries Of The Former Securitate. Ana Blandiana, ‘Intamplari De Pe Strada Mea\u0026rsquo; (‘Events From My Street\u0026rsquo;).” Studia Universitatis Babes-Bolyai. 61(2): 2006, pp. 97-100.\nHappy researching!\nBooks You will select the book from the list below.

	"content": "Before completing this assignment, read the recently revised, HTML version of the handout “The Ruin: Digital Literary Studies” and carry out the exercises it asks you to do.\n  What is The Ruin? Briefly describe the poem and its themes. State what passage you are focusing on and analyze its poetic characteristics, as discussed in class. Be specific; cite poem by line numbers. Cite Echard\u0026rsquo;s online translation correctly using the citation format of your choice.\n  What is “deformance,” as defined by McGann and Davidson, and how did you practice deformance on The Ruin? Cite McGann and Davidson correctly using the citation format of your choice.\n  Describe the literary study methodology we used. Make sure you answer the following questions:\n  What is TEI? How did we use it? (Your own words, please.)\n  What tag did you create? What is it supposed to describe? Why did you choose it? Include at least one screenshot of the viewing screen with your TEI code, XSLT code, and results.\n  What did you learn from making these digital artifacts that simply reading the poem did not uncover? What is the most significant affordance of your tools and digital artifacts that enabled you to gain these insights? What failed to work\u0026mdash;that is, what was difficult or counterproductive about working with TEI and XSLT?\n  How does your analysis work with or against the poem\u0026mdash;that is, are you “breaking” or “recreating” the poem? What difference does it make that you are reading an endangered poem\u0026mdash;that is, a poem that comes down to us in fragments, in a single manuscript, in a language no longer spoken?

This handout should contain everything you need to complete the assignment, but please use the discussion forum to ask any technical (or other!) questions.\nThe Poem: “The Ruin” (from the tenth century Exeter Book), translated by Sian Echard, silently emended \u0026ldquo;The Ruin\u0026rdquo; was likely written in the 8th or 9th century, and recorded in the Exeter Book in the 10th century. The only surviving copy has a large burn down the centre of the page that renders parts of the poem illegible. (See this blog post for a substantive discussion of the poem.)\n  Figure 1: Exeter Cathedral Library MS 3501, f. 124r, all rights reserved Dean \u0026amp; Chapter Exeter Cathedral\n  Transcription  Wondrous is this wall-stead, wasted by fate. Battlements broken, giant\u0026rsquo;s work shattered. Roofs are in ruin, towers destroyed, Broken the barred gate, rime on the plaster, walls gape, torn up, destroyed, consumed by age. Earth-grip holds the proud builders, departed, long lost, and the hard grasp of the grave, until a hundred generations of people have passed. Often this wall outlasted, hoary with lichen, red-stained, withstanding the storm, one reign after another; the high arch has now fallen. The wall-stone still stands, hacked by weapons, by grim-ground files. \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; Mind quickened \u0026hellip; and the artificer, skilled in round-building, bound the wall-base, wondrously with iron. Bright were the halls, many the baths, High the gables, great the joyful noise, many the mead-hall full of pleasures. Until fate the mighty overturned it all. Slaughter spread wide, pestilence arose, and death took all those brave men away. Their bulwarks were broken, their halls laid waste, the cities crumbled, those who would repair it laid in the earth. And so these halls are empty, and the curved arch sheds its tiles, torn from the roof. Decay has brought it down, broken it to rubble. Where once many a warrior, high of heart, gold-bright, gleaming in splendour, proud and wine-flushed, shone in armour, looked on a treasure of silver, on precious gems, on riches of pearl\u0026hellip; in that bright city of broad rule. Stone courts once stood there, and hot streams gushed forth, wide floods of water, surrounded by a wall, in its bright bosom, there where the baths were, hot in the middle. Hot streams ran over hoary stone into the ringed water where baths were \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; That was a noble thing, the house and the city.  Deformance We will discuss in class this portmanteau term coined by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann, a combination of “deform” and “performance.” Be sure you have some grasp of what this means!\nIntroduction to XML,XSLT, TEI, and HTML (!) TEI is a markup language \u0026ndash; a system for annotating documents that can be read an processed by other compute programs. It is a format, or defined feature set, of the XML \u0026ldquo;metalanguage\u0026rdquo;, a very widely-used system for structuring and processing many kinds of data. Digital humanists use TEI to turn literary texts into structured data that can be manipulated and queried in many ways, but especially on the web.\nThe process of turning a TEI document into a visual representation on a screen is complex:\n first, the text must be marked up \u0026ndash; textual elements must be identified and annotated (we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss how this works in more detail very soon). This work can be both painstaking and tedious next, a translation scheme must be written that processes the xml text into HTML, the main language of the web. This translation is almost always written in a language called XLST (which is itself a dialect of XML) finally, the translated document must be displayed by a browser that understands HTML, like Firefox or Chrome.  Becasue this topic is so immense, we will not be producing fully TEI-compliant documents in this class \u0026ndash; instead, we will make TEI-like XML and process those docs into super-simple HTML documents.\nSo, in order to complete this assignment, you must learn at least a tiny bit about XML, XSLT, and HTML. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot! I won\u0026rsquo;t give you a systematic introduction to any of these systems; instead, this handout presents a very small amount of information on each, and gives some examples of how you might use them in the assignment.\nViewing To view/work with XML files, please navigate to either of these xml/xslt live editors:\n XML fiddle (this one at least has syntax highlighting, which makes the code a bit easier to read). W3 Schools (I don\u0026rsquo;t like this one as much)  Paste your XML poem into the left window of the editor. Start with this code:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;poem\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;This \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;wall-stone\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; is wondrous; fates broke it\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;courtyard pavements\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; were smashed; the work of giants is decaying.\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;Roofs\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; are fallen, ruinous \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;towers\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;4\u0026#34;\u0026gt; the frosty gate with frost on cement is ravaged, \u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/poem\u0026gt; Paste your XSLT (your script for turning XML into HTML) into the right window of the browser.

The totality of \u0026lt;starting-tag\u0026gt;Content\u0026lt;/end-tag\u0026gt; is called an XML element.\nTake this example (stolen from W3Schools):\n\u0026lt;book category=\u0026#34;children\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Harry Potter\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;author\u0026gt;J K. Rowling\u0026lt;/author\u0026gt; \u0026lt;year\u0026gt;2005\u0026lt;/year\u0026gt; \u0026lt;price\u0026gt;29.99\u0026lt;/price\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/book\u0026gt; Here we have a root element called \u0026lt;book\u0026gt; which encloses several child elements (\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;author\u0026gt;, etc). Everything between \u0026lt;book category=\u0026quot;children\u0026quot;\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;/book\u0026gt; is part of the \u0026lt;book\u0026gt; element. In general, an element has the structure:\n opening tag: \u0026lt;tag\u0026gt; content: text and child elements, which must be fully nexted within the parent (if an opening tag is inside the element, the closing tag must also be inside it closing tag: \u0026lt;/tag\u0026gt; . Note the forward slash / within the \u0026lt;\u0026gt; greater-than less-than signss.  Here\u0026rsquo;s a trivial example that you might find in a TEI document:\n\u0026lt;l\u0026gt;And then my lord \u0026lt;person\u0026gt;Yvain\u0026lt;/person\u0026gt; arrived in \u0026lt;place\u0026gt;Camelot\u0026lt;/place\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; The tags here are \u0026ldquo;l\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;person\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;place\u0026rdquo;.\nThe XML declaration Every real XML document must also begin with an \u0026ldquo;XML Declaration\u0026rdquo; which identifies it as an XML document. It will look like this:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; And a very simple full document will look like this:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;poem\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;This wall-stone is wondrous; fates broke it\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;courtyard pavements were smashed; the work of giants is decaying.\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Roofs are fallen, ruinous towers,\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;4\u0026#34;\u0026gt; the frosty gate with frost on cement is ravaged, \u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/poem\u0026gt; Displaying XML with XSLT A document that has been marked up with XML now has a structure that a computer can understand, which is great! But a web browser will not know how to display that document unless we give it instructions for transforming the XML structure into a language that the browser understands. We use XSLT for this purpose \u0026ndash; a special language that exists to manipulate XML documents.\nXSLT is complicated, and we will use just a tiny part of it. We need to understand just a few concepts:\n stylesheet declaration surrounds the rest of the XSLT document, identifying it as an XSLT instruction set templates give instructions for transforming particular XML elements Xpath Expressions are used to tell the templates which elements to transform value statements insert the contents of an element into the final HTML product  Stylesheet Declaration An XSLT Stylesheet always starts with an XML declaration and then an \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt; tag; the document ends with the closing \u0026lt;/xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt; tag:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; xmlns:xsl=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!--Content of Stylesheet Goes Here!! --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt; XSLT Templates Inside the xsl:stylesheet we put all the xsl:template tags we need. Each template is an instruction for dealing with a particular tag or set of tags. So, if we use our simple XML file from above as the XML source, we might start by building an XSLT document like this:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; xmlns:xsl=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;l\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt; What\u0026rsquo;s happening here? We have two templates. The first one \u0026ldquo;matches\u0026rdquo; the \u0026ldquo;root element\u0026rdquo;, while the second one matches all the \u0026ldquo;l\u0026rdquo; elements. So if we read this document top to bottom, we might translate it this way:\nI am an XML Document Begin Stylesheet Begin Template for the root element Apply all Templates! End Template for the root elements Begin Template for each l element Return a line of code that reads: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt; + content of the \u0026#34;l\u0026#34; element + \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026#34; (this creates one HTML paragraph for each \u0026#34;l\u0026#34; element in the original) End Template for the L Elements End Stylesheet Our original XML document is very simple, so we don\u0026rsquo;t need much more than this. But as we\u0026rsquo;ll see later, it can get much more complicated. And in fact we can make it a little more sophisticated already by adding a bit more complexity:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; xmlns:xsl=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Grand title\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Let us begin our discussion of poetry here.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;poem\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;The Ruin\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;l\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt; Try to read the text and understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on!\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s learn a little bit more about how the match and select attributes in the above code really work.\nXpath Expressions When we make templates with a match attribute, or use the value-of and apply-templates instructions (see below), we have to tell XSLT which XML elements we are talking about. The selection of elements is done using what are called \u0026ldquo;Xpath Expressions\u0026quot;. These are a way to describe the position of elements (sometimes called \u0026ldquo;nodes\u0026rdquo;) in the XML document. The syntax is extemely complex, so we will just say a few things about it here:\n \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo; refers to the root element \u0026ndash; the element that contains all the other elements in the document \u0026quot;/poem\u0026quot; refers to a \u0026lt;poem\u0026gt; element at the document root, while \u0026ldquo;poem\u0026rdquo; refers to any poem element in the document. So for instance, \u0026ldquo;l\u0026rdquo; will match all of our \u0026lt;l\u0026gt; elements, but \u0026quot;/l\u0026quot; won\u0026rsquo;t match anything, because the existing \u0026lt;l\u0026gt; elements are all inside the poem element. \u0026ldquo;current()\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;.\u0026rdquo; both refer to the element that is being discussed at the present moment. So, inside of \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026quot;poem\u0026quot;\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt;, \u0026quot;.\u0026quot; refers to the \u0026lt;poem\u0026gt; element. \u0026ldquo;@n\u0026rdquo; refers to the \u0026ldquo;attribute\u0026rdquo; n. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain more about this in a second\u0026hellip;  Value Statements (value-of and apply-templates) We almost always want to get the value of the XML elements \u0026ndash; otherwise why would we do all this work? There are two ways to get that value\u0026hellip;\n xsl:value-of: the simple way  `\u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;` just grabs the content of the element and inserts it in the final output. We don't use it much (see below for reasons), but it can be particularly helpful when we care about **attributes**. So for instance, consider this line of XML: ```xml \u0026lt;l n=\u0026quot;2\u0026quot;\u0026gt;courtyard pavements were smashed; the work of giants is decaying.\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; ``` Maybe we really care that this is line 2! Maybe we want to display those line numbers so readers understand what we're talking about! We can use the \u0026quot;@n\u0026quot; syntax we saw just above: ```xml \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026quot;@n\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; ``` When this instruction is applied to the line above, it will return the number \u0026quot;2\u0026quot;!   xsl:apply-templates: the better way (usually)  Most of the time, we use `\u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates/\u0026gt;` instead of `\u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;`. This is because **we usually can't be sure that the element doesn't contain other elements.** And if we just use \u0026quot;value-of\u0026quot;, then the elements inside our current element won't be properly translated. \u0026quot;apply-templates\u0026quot; will check to see if any templates need to be applied internally, and then after those templates have been applied, it will return the whole resultant text. All of this is really helpful -- but since we're generating HTML, you **also** need to know a little bit of HTML to make the text look the way you want it to!  HTML Tags and attributes I won\u0026rsquo;t go into HTML in much depth \u0026ndash; there are many many many resources available online. Here we\u0026rsquo;ll just describe a few very basic features.\nLike XML documents, HTML documents contain elements delimited by tags. Also like in XML, those tags can have attributes that give extra information. Here are some tags you may want to use in your work:\n\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; Every HTML document should start with a \u0026#34;html\u0026#34; tag and include a \u0026#34;body\u0026#34; tag inside it. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first-level header\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;second=level header\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; (etc up to \u0026#34;h6\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; paragraph containing \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;bold\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;italic\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; text. Paragraphs can also contain \u0026lt;span\u0026gt; tags, which don\u0026#39;t do anything by default... but wait! \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p style=\u0026#34;color;white;background-color:red;border:2px solid black; padding: 10px;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; This paragraph will have white text, a red background, a black border, and lots of space around it. Meanwhile, this \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;color:red;background-color:green\u0026#34;\u0026gt; will be entirely invisible to red-green colorblind readers. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;this is a \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;table with\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;1 row and 3 columns\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;  p tags are paragraphs h1, h2\u0026hellip; h6 tags are headers span tags delineate text within a paragraph strong and em do bold and italics You can build tables using the somewhat complicated syntax above you can set style attributes using the \u0026ldquo;style=\u0026rdquo; commands as you see them above; I\u0026rsquo;ve shown a few possibilities but there are literally hundreds more.  Hopefully this should be enough for you to get started!\nLearn more The Mozilla Developer Network is the best starting point for almost all technical topics related to the web. The XML Introduction, XSLT Intro, and much more extensive HTML information are all very helpful, and contian links to further information.\nThe TEI website has extensive information about the TEI standard, but is extremely technical. TEI By Example can be quite helpful, but again, is very detailed. The full text of What is the Text Encoding Initiative is available online and may also be helpful. The University of Nebraska\u0026rsquo;s Basic Guide to Text Encoding is a lightweight introduction that may be easier to follow than any of the above!\nReading Hints  Content: Read your passage. Flag any parts that are unclear or mysterious or confusing. Summarize its content in one sentence. Style: Look for:  verbal patterns (e.g. sentences with the same shape) : what are they? What is their effect? sensory imagery (e.g. references to what you can see, hear, touch, feel): any patterns? What do they do for the poem?   Theme: if you had to summarize the theme of your passage in one word, what would that word be? How does style support or embody theme?  Encoding Choose one of the following passages: 1-15; 16-31a; 31b-46.\nEncode your passage using the following TEI tags:\n Lines and line numbers  \u0026lt;poem\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=″1″\u0026gt;This masonry is wondrous; fates broke it\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/poem\u0026gt;  At least one made-up tag of your own, specific to the poem  \u0026lt;concrete_noun\u0026gt; wall-stone \u0026lt;/concrete_noun\u0026gt; \u0026lt;adjective\u0026gt; wondrous \u0026lt;/adjective\u0026gt; \u0026lt;colour\u0026gt;golden\u0026lt;/colour\u0026gt; \u0026lt;poetic-formula\u0026gt;the work of giants\u0026lt;/thew Encoding Discussion What is your made-up tag(s)? How is this tag supposed to work, within this poem and more generally? Why is it useful?\nAfter encoding, what additional characteristics of the poem, if any, did you notice in terms of verbal patterns, sensory imagery, or the development of the poem\u0026rsquo;s themes?\nAppendix: More Complex Example It may help you to see a few more tags. Here is a slightly more complex example, with a more completely marked-up selection of the poem. I have not annotated this example, but it showcases a few more features of the systems we\u0026rsquo;re learning. In particular, this example introduces:\n more complex colors the \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; or hyperlink tag curly braces as a shortcut for xpaths the somewhat confusing xpath test \u0026ldquo;node\u0026rdquo;, which sometimes makes sense to use when \u0026ldquo;current()\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t produce the effect you want.  \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;poem\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;This \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;wall-stone\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; is \u0026lt;adjective\u0026gt;wondrous\u0026lt;/adjective\u0026gt;; \u0026lt;hyperbole\u0026gt;fates broke it\u0026lt;/hyperbole\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;courtyard pavements\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; were smashed; the \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;work\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; of \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;giants\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; is decaying.\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;Roofs\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; are fallen, ruinous \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;towers\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;4\u0026#34;\u0026gt; the frosty \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;gate\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; with \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;frost\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; on \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;cement\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; is \u0026lt;hard-word\u0026gt;ravaged\u0026lt;/hard-word\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/poem\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; xmlns:xsl=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;The Ruin\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;poem\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;l\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td style=\u0026#34;padding-right:10px; color:gray\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026#34;@n\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td style=\u0026#34;color:white;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;concrete-noun\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;strong style=\u0026#34;color:black;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;adjective\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;color:green\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;hyperbole\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;background-color: rgba(250,20,20,0.3)\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;hard-word\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a style=\u0026#34;background-color: rgba(20,250,20,0.3)\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://www-oed-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/search?q={current()}\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt; "

Down right now!)  This project profile is not an essay; it is a short, 1-2 page report. You do not need to write a formal introduction, thesis, argument, or conclusion. You should only report on your observations, using the questions below as categories of analysis, each with its own heading. Not all categories and questions apply to all projects, so do not feel obligated to respond to all of them. Your project profile will be evaluated for accuracy, clarity, detail, quality of analysis, and insight.\n  Project: What is the name of the project? Who are its primary authors?\n  Topic: What is the project about? (Examples: What topic and historical period does it focus on? What texts or art works or other material does it collect, explain, map, or analyze? What questions is the project seeking to answer?)\n  People \u0026amp; Institutions: Who is the project leader? Who are their collaborators? What is the institution involved in the project\u0026rsquo;s development? What are the granting bodies funding the projects? Is credit given to individual contributors? To what extent?\n  Presentation \u0026amp; User Experience: What is the “digital artifact” through which this project communicates its findings? A book? A game? A map? An edition? An archive? A tool? Another type of digital artifact?\nAs a user external to the project, what steps did you take to explore the project? Can you understand how to read the project\u0026rsquo;s data or how to use the tools it is building? As you explore the project, what do you find easy? What do you find difficult? What do you like? What do you dislike? Document your experience with screenshots, please (firefox\u0026rsquo;s screenshot tool makes this very easy).\nDoes this project provide access to users with e.g. limited bandwidth, minimal computing (e.g. smartphones instead of laptops), vision or hearing or tactile impairment?\n  Data: What data does the project generate? What data format(s): text files, pdf files, digital images, databases, Excel or .csv files? Does the project provide narrative context for its data (that is, does it clearly explain what its data means and why it matters, for readers not familiar with the project)? Is access to project data open, subscription-only, or under a specific licence? May other scholars download the project\u0026rsquo;s data?\n  Technologies: What technologies (encoding formats, digital publication platforms, software) are used in this project or built as part of this project? Are these technologies open-source, open-access?\n  Audience: Who is the intended audience for this project? That is, does this project primarily speak to laypeople? Scholars? Specialists? How can you tell?\n  Limitations: Does the project make note of any limitations in its work, any gaps or uncertainties in its data? Can you find limitations in its work\u0026mdash;that is, gaps between its stated goals and its results?\n  This assignment is based on the DMP Tool, the U of T DH Census Profile tool, and Kristen Mapes\u0026rsquo; DH Project Critique assignment.\n"

DH studies human culture \u0026ndash; art, literature, history, geography, religion \u0026ndash; through computational tools and methodologies; and, in turn, DH studies digital artifacts through humanist lenses, as complex cultural objects shaped by wider social, political, and philosophical concerns. Digital humanists analyze languages through digital text collections; build digital archives of forbidden books; construct video games to study literature; or resurrect historical cities through digital maps.\nThis year, the course once again focuses on endangered books: fragile, hidden, censored, forbidden. We speak to scholars who build archives of forbidden literature. We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. We study rare books\u0026rsquo; histories through digital exhibits. By the end of the course, you will have mastered concepts and technologies you can use in future courses and workplaces: text encoding and data visualization, data analysis and digital exhibit platforms. And you will learn how our stories and cultural conversations work and shapeshift through digital environments.\nLearning Goals By the end of the course:\n You will be able to describe the history and intellectual landscape of the digital humanities, including the central concepts, debates, projects, and digital tools current in the discipline. You will have developed a set of best practices around datasets, project design and management, and data curation. You will have analyzed data and digital artifacts as complex cultural objects, shaped by, and shaping, how we live, think, and know.  Through hands-on workshops:\n You will experiment with text encoding, quantitative text analysis, and text-based videogames as tools of scholarly research You will create and analyze data visualizations You will research and author your own digital exhibit  Course Readings \u0026amp; Technologies Course readings will be available either as links in the syllabus or via the course Quercus site each week. You are responsible for checking the Quercus site and ensuring you receive course announcements posted via Quercus.\nAll technologies used in this course are open-source or, in rare cases, licensed for use by U of T students. You will need access to a working computer to complete the work for this course.\nHow This Course Works Each week we have three hours of class, which include lecture, discussion, and hands-on work in the computer lab. Much of your course work will be done in class, in facilitated environments and hands-on workshops. Given the fast pace and praxis-oriented environment, you must come to class on time, all the time: it is all too easy, otherwise, to get lost. If this poses a problem, please let me know as soon as possible.\nAccessibility Students with diverse learning styles and needs are more than welcome in this course. Please feel free to approach me or Accessibility Services so we can assist you in achieving academic success in this course.\nSee A\u0026amp;S Accessibility Website for more details on the Accessibility policy.\nGrading Scheme    Assignment % Due Date     Short Assignments (3) 45 Sep. 19, Oct. 10, Nov. 21   Participation 10 All semester; alternatives.   Book Project: Consultation 1 Oct. 11-25, in office hours or by appointment   Book Project: Proposal \u0026amp; Annotated Bibliography 9 Nov. 01   Book Project: Digital Exhibit 35 Nov. 29   Total 100      Reflections include in-class digital artifacts as well as discussion of course readings. You will work on reflections in class as well as outside class, and you will hand them in via Quercus. 400-500 words maximum.  Graded Work Participation Every week, you are also responsible for coming to the lab and undertaking the project or field trip of the week in a facilitated environment. This is where you can explore, experiment, fail creatively: all I require is engaged participation—that is, you come to class, do the hands-on computer work, ask questions, and engage in class discussion. If you miss class or are more than ten minutes late for class, you will miss the grades, unless your absence is excused.\nShort Assignments You are responsible for writing three short assignments in this course. These include discussions of in-class digital artifacts as well as course readings. You will work on these assignments in class as well as outside class, and you will hand them in via Quercus. They need not be perfect, just done.700 words approximately.\nDH Project Profile Your first assignment is to profile a Digital Humanities project, analyzing its research aims, its form and content, its interface, technologies, and intended audience. 500-700 words. You will select the project from a sign-up list available via our course site.\nBook Project Your major assignment in this course is to tell the story of a banned, challenged, or endangered book through a digital exhibit.\nContact I love hearing from you! The best way to contact me is to talk to me in person in office hours. I also answer emails at matt.price@utoronto.ca within 48 hours or fewer on business days. However, I do not answer email after 5:00 p.m. or on weekends, and I do not expect you to do so, either. Please email me as soon as possible to make sure you receive your answers in good time.\nDue Dates \u0026amp; Late Penalties  Assignments Assignments are due at the beginning of each class. Late assignments will be penalized three percentage points per day unless you have prior permission from the instructor in writing (email). (Of course, late penalties do not apply when the lateness was caused by illness, bereavement, or other serious circumstances outside students\u0026rsquo; control. For religious observances, please notify instructor before the due date.) Lab Work If you miss a class, you are responsible for catching up with the work and will not receive credit for that class. (Of course, I will not penalize you if your absence is caused by illness, bereavement, religious observances, or other serious circumstances outside students\u0026rsquo; control.) Documentation needed for extensions As a matter of fairness to all students, you may be required to support any request for extensions or makeup test with supporting documentation. For medical issues, documentation consists of UofT\u0026rsquo;s Verification of Student Illness or Injury form. For non-medical issues, documentation consists of a note from the student\u0026rsquo;s College Registrar, social worker, clergy etc. Non-medical notes must contain the same information requested on U of T\u0026rsquo;s Verification of Student Illness or Injury form. Re-marking The deadline for requesting a re-marking is one week from the date the term work was made available for pickup. Unfortunately, I am unable to accept late re-marking requests.  Academic Integrity In this course, you will work with texts, objects, and digital artifacts. As you navigate the world of digital cultural heritage and write for a wider public, you are allowed (indeed, encouraged!) to use the work of others \u0026ndash; but you must carefully and conscientiously acknowledge your sources, give credit where credit is due, and respect the University of Toronto\u0026rsquo;s expectations of academic integrity.\nAcknowledgments This syllabus was originally written by Alexandra Bolintineanu, and draws on both Kristen Mapes\u0026rsquo; Introduction to Digital Humanities, AL285 and on Miriam Posner\u0026rsquo;s DH101: Introduction to Digital Humanities Fall 2014, UCLA.\nCourse Overview (Subject to Change) 1 (Sep. 05) Introduction to Digital Humanities What is “Digital Humanities”? We discuss the range of projects, activities, and concerns of this growing field, and collaboratively survey representative projects from around the world. We discuss DH in relation to the theme of the course, banned books.\nTool Workshop: Twine  How do digital media change possibilities for humanists to express themselves and craft persuasive arguments? We experiment via a popular game-design tool.  2 (Sep. 12) The Anatomy of DH Projects We discuss the components of digital humanities projects—data, code, tools, platforms, standards and communities of practice—as they manifest across a gallery of projects, living or dead. We investigate success, failure, and sustainability in DH projects. We collaboratively analyze two DH projects, peering “under the hood” of their technical framework and examining their research questions, digital artifacts, user experiences and intended audiences, and disciplinary implications.\nReadings and Discussion:  Miriam Posner, “How Did They Make That?” (2013) Alan Galey \u0026amp; Stan Ruecker, “How a Prototype Argues” (2010) (in-class discussion)  Reflection Handed Out: DH Project Profile Due Sep. 19\n3 (Sep. 19) Digital Texts: Reading and Writing  Kinds of danger, types of responses Using digital methods to discover and highlight new understanding of literary texts  Readings \u0026amp; Discussion:  Lisa Samuels and Jerome J.
