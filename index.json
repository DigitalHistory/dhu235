	"content": " In this assignment, you will encode parts of a thousand-year-old poem using a markup language, display the marked-up text in a web browser using a computational translator, and discuss this exercise using the idea of deformance as a guide. This handout should contain everything you need to complete the assignment, but please use the discussion forum to ask any technical (or other!) questions.\nThe Poem: “The Ruin” (from the tenth century Exeter Book), translated by Sian Echard, silently emended \u0026ldquo;The Ruin\u0026rdquo; was likely written in the 8th or 9th century, and recorded in the Exeter Book in the 10th century. The only surviving copy has a large burn down the centre of the page that renders parts of the poem illegible. (See this blog post for a substantive discussion of the poem.)\n  Figure 1: Exeter Cathedral Library MS 3501, f. 124r, all rights reserved Dean \u0026amp; Chapter Exeter Cathedral\n  Transcription  Wondrous is this wall-stead, wasted by fate. Battlements broken, giant\u0026rsquo;s work shattered. Roofs are in ruin, towers destroyed, Broken the barred gate, rime on the plaster, walls gape, torn up, destroyed, consumed by age. Earth-grip holds the proud builders, departed, long lost, and the hard grasp of the grave, until a hundred generations of people have passed. Often this wall outlasted, hoary with lichen, red-stained, withstanding the storm, one reign after another; the high arch has now fallen. The wall-stone still stands, hacked by weapons, by grim-ground files. \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; Mind quickened \u0026hellip; and the artificer, skilled in round-building, bound the wall-base, wondrously with iron. Bright were the halls, many the baths, High the gables, great the joyful noise, many the mead-hall full of pleasures. Until fate the mighty overturned it all. Slaughter spread wide, pestilence arose, and death took all those brave men away. Their bulwarks were broken, their halls laid waste, the cities crumbled, those who would repair it laid in the earth. And so these halls are empty, and the curved arch sheds its tiles, torn from the roof. Decay has brought it down, broken it to rubble. Where once many a warrior, high of heart, gold-bright, gleaming in splendour, proud and wine-flushed, shone in armour, looked on a treasure of silver, on precious gems, on riches of pearl\u0026hellip; in that bright city of broad rule. Stone courts once stood there, and hot streams gushed forth, wide floods of water, surrounded by a wall, in its bright bosom, there where the baths were, hot in the middle. Hot streams ran over hoary stone into the ringed water where baths were \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; That was a noble thing, the house and the city.  Deformance We discussed in class this portmanteau term coined by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann, a combination of “deform” and “performance.” Be sure you have some grasp of what this means!\nIntroduction to XML,XSLT, TEI, and HTML (!) TEI is a markup language \u0026ndash; a system for annotating documents that can be read an processed by other compute programs. It is a format, or defined feature set, of the XML \u0026ldquo;metalanguage\u0026rdquo;, a very widely-used system for structuring and processing many kinds of data. Digital humanists use TEI to turn literary texts into structured data that can be manipulated and queried in many ways, but especially on the web.\nThe process of turning a TEI document into a visual representation on a screen is complex:\n first, the text must be marked up \u0026ndash; textual elements must be identified and annotated (we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss how this works in more detail very soon). This work can be both painstaking and tedious next, a translation scheme must be written that processes the xml text into HTML, the main language of the web. This translation is almost always written in a language called XLST (which is itself a dialect of XML) finally, the translated document must be displayed by a browser that understands HTML, like Firefox or Chrome.  Becasue this topic is so immense, we will not be producing fully TEI-compliant documents in this class \u0026ndash; instead, we will make TEI-like XML and process those docs into super-simple HTML documents.\nSo, in order to complete this assignment, you must learn at least a tiny bit about XML, XSLT, and HTML. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot! I won\u0026rsquo;t give you a systematic introduction to any of these systems; instead, this handout presents a very small amount of information on each, and gives some examples of how you might use them in the assignment.\nViewing To view/work with XML files, please navigate to either of these xml/xslt live editors:\n W3 Schools XML fiddle (this one at least has syntax highlighting, which makes the code a bit easier to read).  Paste your XML poem into the left window of the editor. Start with this code:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;poem\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;This \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;wall-stone\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; is wondrous; fates broke it\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;courtyard pavements\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; were smashed; the work of giants is decaying.\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;Roofs\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; are fallen, ruinous \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;towers\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;4\u0026#34;\u0026gt; the frosty gate with frost on cement is ravaged, \u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/poem\u0026gt; Paste your XSLT (your script for turning XML into HTML) into the right window of the browser.\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; xmlns:xsl=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;The Ruin\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:for-each select=\u0026#34;poem/l/concrete-noun\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026#34;current()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:for-each\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt; XML Essentials: Tags \u0026amp; Structures XML \u0026ldquo;marks up\u0026rdquo; elements of a text by surrounding bits of text with tags. The totality of \u0026lt;starting-tag\u0026gt;Content\u0026lt;/end-tag\u0026gt; is called an XML element.\nTake this example (stolen from W3Schools):\n\u0026lt;book category=\u0026#34;children\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Harry Potter\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;author\u0026gt;J K. Rowling\u0026lt;/author\u0026gt; \u0026lt;year\u0026gt;2005\u0026lt;/year\u0026gt; \u0026lt;price\u0026gt;29.99\u0026lt;/price\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/book\u0026gt; Here we have a root element called \u0026lt;book\u0026gt; which encloses several child elements (\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;author\u0026gt;, etc). Everything between \u0026lt;book category=\u0026quot;children\u0026quot;\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;/book\u0026gt; is part of the \u0026lt;book\u0026gt; element. In general, an element has the structure:\n opening tag: \u0026lt;tag\u0026gt; content: text and child elements, which must be fully nexted within the parent (if an opening tag is inside the element, the closing tag must also be inside it closing tag: \u0026lt;/tag\u0026gt; . Note the forward slash / within the \u0026lt;\u0026gt; greater-than less-than signss.  Here\u0026rsquo;s a trivial example that you might find in a TEI document:\n\u0026lt;l\u0026gt;And then my lord \u0026lt;person\u0026gt;Yvain\u0026lt;/person\u0026gt; arrived in \u0026lt;place\u0026gt;Camelot\u0026lt;/place\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; The tags here are \u0026ldquo;l\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;person\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;place\u0026rdquo;.\nThe XML declaration Every real XML document must also begin with an \u0026ldquo;XML Declaration\u0026rdquo; which identifies it as an XML document. It will look like this:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; And a very simple full document will look like this:\n\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;poem\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;This wall-stone is wondrous; fates broke it\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;courtyard pavements were smashed; the work of giants is decaying.\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Roofs are fallen, ruinous towers,\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;4\u0026#34;\u0026gt; the frosty gate with frost on cement is ravaged, \u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/poem\u0026gt; Displaying XML with XSLT A document that has been marked up with XML now has a structure that a computer can understand, which is great! But a web browser will not know how to display that document unless we give it instructions for transforming the XML structure into a language that the browser understands. We use XSLT for this purpose \u0026ndash; a special language that exists to manipulate XML documents.\nXSLT is complicated, and we will use just a tiny part of it. We need to understand just a few concepts:\n stylesheet declaration surrounds the rest of the XSLT document, identifying it as an XSLT instruction set templates give instructions for transforming particular XML elements Xpath Expressions are used to tell the templates which elements to transform value statements insert the contents of an element into the final HTML product  Stylesheet Declaration An XSLT Stylesheet always starts with an XML declaration and then an \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt; tag; the document ends with the closing \u0026lt;/xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt; tag:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; xmlns:xsl=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Content of Stylesheet Goes Here!! --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt; XSLT Templates Inside the xsl:stylesheet we put all the xsl:template tags we need. Each template is an instruction for dealing with a particular tag or set of tags. So, if we use our simple XML file from above as the XML source, we might start by building an XSLT document like this:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; xmlns:xsl=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;l\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt; What\u0026rsquo;s happening here? We have two templates. The first one \u0026ldquo;matches\u0026rdquo; the \u0026ldquo;root element\u0026rdquo;, while the second one matches all the \u0026ldquo;l\u0026rdquo; elements. So if we read this document top to bottom, we might translate it this way:\nI am an XML Document Begin Stylesheet Begin Template for the root element Apply all Templates! End Template for the root elements Begin Template for each l element Return a line of code that reads: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt; + content of the \u0026#34;l\u0026#34; element + \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026#34; (this creates one HTML paragraph for each \u0026#34;l\u0026#34; element in the original) End Template for the L Elements End Stylesheet Our original XML document is very simple, so we don\u0026rsquo;t need much more than this. But as we\u0026rsquo;ll see later, it can get much more complicated. And in fact we can make it a little more sophisticated already by adding a bit more complexity:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; xmlns:xsl=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Grand title\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Let us begin our discussion of poetry here.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;poem\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;The Ruin\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;l\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt; Try to read the text and understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on!\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s learn a little bit more about how the match and select attributes in the above code really work.\nXpath Expressions When we make templates with a match attribute, or use the value-of and apply-templates instructions (see below), we have to tell XSLT which XML elements we are talking about. The selection of elements is done using what are called \u0026ldquo;Xpath Expressions\u0026rdquo;. These are a way to describe the position of elements (sometimes called \u0026ldquo;nodes\u0026rdquo;) in the XML document. The syntax is extemely complex, so we will just say a few things about it here:\n \u0026rdquo;/\u0026rdquo; refers to the root element \u0026ndash; the element that contains all the other elements in the document \u0026quot;/poem\u0026quot; refers to a \u0026lt;poem\u0026gt; element at the document root, while \u0026ldquo;poem\u0026rdquo; refers to any poem element in the document. So for instance, \u0026ldquo;l\u0026rdquo; will match all of our \u0026lt;l\u0026gt; elements, but \u0026quot;/l\u0026quot; won\u0026rsquo;t match anything, because the existing \u0026lt;l\u0026gt; elements are all inside the poem element. \u0026ldquo;current()\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;.\u0026rdquo; both refer to the element that is being discussed at the present moment. So, inside of \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026quot;poem\u0026quot;\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt;, \u0026quot;.\u0026quot; refers to the \u0026lt;poem\u0026gt; element. \u0026rdquo;@n\u0026rdquo; refers to the \u0026ldquo;attribute\u0026rdquo; n. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain more about this in a second\u0026hellip;  Value Statements (value-of and apply-templates) We almost always want to get the value of the XML elements \u0026ndash; otherwise why would we do all this work? There are two ways to get that value\u0026hellip;\n xsl:value-of: the simple way\n\u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; just grabs the content of the element and inserts it in the final output. We don\u0026rsquo;t use it much (see below for reasons), but it can be particularly helpful when we care about attributes. So for instance, consider this line of XML:\n\u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;courtyard pavements were smashed; the work of giants is decaying.\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; Maybe we really care that this is line 2! Maybe we want to display those line numbers so readers understand what we\u0026rsquo;re talking about! We can use the \u0026ldquo;@n\u0026rdquo; syntax we saw just above:\n\u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026#34;@n\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; When this instruction is applied to the line above, it will return the number \u0026ldquo;2\u0026rdquo;!\n xsl:apply-templates: the better way (usually)\nMost of the time, we use \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates/\u0026gt; instead of \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;. This is because we usually can\u0026rsquo;t be sure that the element doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain other elements. And if we just use \u0026ldquo;value-of\u0026rdquo;, then the elements inside our current element won\u0026rsquo;t be properly translated. \u0026ldquo;apply-templates\u0026rdquo; will check to see if any templates need to be applied internally, and then after those templates have been applied, it will return the whole resultant text.\nAll of this is really helpful \u0026ndash; but since we\u0026rsquo;re generating HTML, you also need to know a little bit of HTML to make the text look the way you want it to!\n  HTML Tags and attributes I won\u0026rsquo;t go into HTML in much depth \u0026ndash; there are many many resources available online. Here we\u0026rsquo;ll just describe a few very basic features.\nLike XML documents, HTML documents contain elements delimited by tags. Also like in XML, those tags can have attributes that give extra information. Here are some tags you may want to use in your work:\n\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; Every HTML document should start with a \u0026#34;html\u0026#34; tag and include a \u0026#34;body\u0026#34; tag inside it. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first-level header\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;second=level header\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; (etc up to \u0026#34;h6\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; paragraph containing \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;bold\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;italic\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; text. Paragraphs can also contain \u0026lt;span\u0026gt; tags, which don\u0026#39;t do anything by default... but wait! \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p style=\u0026#34;color;white;background-color:red;border:2px solid black; padding: 10px;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; This paragraph will have white text, a red background, a black border, and lots of space around it. Meanwhile, this \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;color:red;background-color:green\u0026#34;\u0026gt; will be entirely invisible to red-green colorblind readers. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;this is a \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;table with\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;1 row and 3 columns\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;  p tags are paragraphs h1, h2\u0026hellip; h6 tags are headers span tags delineate text within a paragraph strong and em do bold and italics You can build tables using the somewhat complicated syntax above you can set style attributes using the \u0026ldquo;style=\u0026rdquo; commands as you see them above; I\u0026rsquo;ve shown a few possibilities but there are literally hundreds more.

Flag any parts that are unclear or mysterious or confusing. Summarize its content in one sentence.\n Style: Look for:\n verbal patterns (e.g. sentences with the same shape) : what are they? What is their effect?\n sensory imagery (e.g. references to what you can see, hear, touch, feel): any patterns? What do they do for the poem?\n  Theme: if you had to summarize the theme of your passage in one word, what would that word be? How does style support or embody theme?\n  Encoding Choose one of the following passages: 1-15; 16-31a; 31b-46.\nEncode your passage using the following TEI tags:\n Lines and line numbers  \u0026lt;poem\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=″1″\u0026gt;This masonry is wondrous; fates broke it\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/poem\u0026gt;  At least one made-up tag of your own, specific to the poem  \u0026lt;concrete_noun\u0026gt; wall-stone \u0026lt;/concrete_noun\u0026gt; \u0026lt;adjective\u0026gt; wondrous \u0026lt;/adjective\u0026gt; \u0026lt;colour\u0026gt;golden\u0026lt;/colour\u0026gt; \u0026lt;poetic-formula\u0026gt;the work of giants\u0026lt;/thew Encoding Discussion What is your made-up tag(s)? How is this tag supposed to work, within this poem and more generally? Why is it useful?\nAfter encoding, what additional characteristics of the poem, if any, did you notice in terms of verbal patterns, sensory imagery, or the development of the poem\u0026rsquo;s themes?\nAppendix: More Complex Example It may help you to see a few more tags. Here is a slightly more complex example, with a more completely marked-up selection of the poem. I have not annotated this example, but it showcases a few more features of the systems we\u0026rsquo;re learning. In particular, this example introduces:\n more complex colors the \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; or hyperlink tag curly braces as a shortcut for xpaths the somewhat confusing xpath test \u0026ldquo;node\u0026rdquo;, which sometimes makes sense to use when \u0026ldquo;current()\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t produce the effect you want.  \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;poem\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;This \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;wall-stone\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; is \u0026lt;adjective\u0026gt;wondrous\u0026lt;/adjective\u0026gt;; \u0026lt;hyperbole\u0026gt;fates broke it\u0026lt;/hyperbole\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;courtyard pavements\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; were smashed; the \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;work\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; of \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;giants\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; is decaying.\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;Roofs\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; are fallen, ruinous \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;towers\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;l n=\u0026#34;4\u0026#34;\u0026gt; the frosty \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;gate\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; with \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;frost\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; on \u0026lt;concrete-noun\u0026gt;cement\u0026lt;/concrete-noun\u0026gt; is \u0026lt;hard-word\u0026gt;ravaged\u0026lt;/hard-word\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;/l\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/poem\u0026gt;\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:stylesheet version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; xmlns:xsl=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;The Ruin\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;poem\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;l\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td style=\u0026#34;padding-right:10px; color:gray\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026#34;@n\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td style=\u0026#34;color:white;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;concrete-noun\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;strong style=\u0026#34;color:black;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;adjective\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;color:green\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;hyperbole\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;background-color: rgba(250,20,20,0.3)\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;hard-word\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a style=\u0026#34;background-color: rgba(20,250,20,0.3)\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://www-oed-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/search?q={current()}\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:apply-templates select=\u0026#34;node()\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:stylesheet\u0026gt;"

	"content": "Before completing this assignment, read the handout “The Ruin: Digital Literary Studies” and carry out the exercises it asks you to do.\n What is The Ruin? Briefly describe the poem and its themes. State what passage you are focusing on and analyze its poetic characteristics, as discussed in class. Be specific; cite poem by line numbers. Cite Echard\u0026rsquo;s online translation correctly using the citation format of your choice.\n What is “deformance,” as defined by McGann and Davidson, and how did you practice deformance on The Ruin? Cite McGann and Davidson correctly using the citation format of your choice.\n Describe the literary study methodology we used. Make sure you answer the following questions:\n What is TEI? How did we use it? (Your own words, please.)\n What tag did you create? What is it supposed to describe? Why did you choose it? Include at least one screenshot of the viewing screen with your TEI code, XSLT code, and results.\n What did you learn from making these digital artifacts that simply reading the poem did not uncover? What is the most significant affordance of your tools and digital artifacts that enabled you to gain these insights? What failed to work\u0026mdash;that is, what was difficult or counterproductive about working with TEI and XSLT?\n How does your analysis work with or against the poem\u0026mdash;that is, are you “breaking” or “recreating” the poem? What difference does it make that you are reading an endangered poem\u0026mdash;that is, a poem that comes down to us in fragments, in a single manuscript, in a language no longer spoken? Be as specific as possible.\n   Reflection II: Evaluation\nThis assignment is graded out of 20.\nIntro (/4)\n A clear contextualization of The Ruin: its manuscript context, its historical period, and its content.\n A clear definition of “deformance” (McGann \u0026amp; Samuels).\n  TEI (/6)\n A clear definition of TEI in the students\u0026rsquo; own words is present (/2)\n Screenshots of TEI and XSLT code are present; output of the TEI and XSLT code is present (/2)\n Student invent their own XML tag, highlighting a consequential aspect of the poem (/2)\n  Analysis (/6)\n Discussion of imagery, stylistic devices, literary strategies, and thematics of the poem is present\n Students\u0026rsquo; observations are specific \u0026ndash; that is, observations could not apply to any Old English poem (“alliteration creates rhythm in the poem”) or to any text (“verbs describe the action in the poem”); instead, they point out characteristics of this particular poem.\n Using their own XML tag, students observe interesting poetic details and discuss these details\u0026rsquo; thematic effects\n  Clarity \u0026amp; Correctness (/4)\n Sentences are clear and vivid. Word usage, grammar, sentence structure, and punctuation are correct. Some informality is acceptable, as long as the reflection is clearly readable.  "

	"content": " Overview In this assignment, you get to tell the story of a banned book you have seen in person, either from the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library or from our list.\nYou will create a website that features a digital collection and exhibit about that book, using the free, open-source content management platform Omeka. Like a good museum curator, you will bring together a gallery of exciting pictures, and you will guide your visitors through that gallery through a well-researched, interesting narrative about your book.\n Your digital collection will catalogue evidence about your book: photographs of the book itself (title page, illustrations, marginal annotations, damage, other interesting features); images of related books from other museums; manuscript illuminations; other relevant multimedia. Each object of your digital collection will be described systematically, as books are described in a library catalogue.\n Your exhibit will be a guided tour about your book and the circumstances under which it was banned.\n You will use some digital technology as part of this assignment.\n  This is a scaffolded assignment: that is, you will produce several components at each stage, and each component builds on the ones before it\u0026ndash; like LEGO, except you get to build your own bricks.\nLearning Goals By the end of this learning module, you will have learned:\n How to understand your book\u0026rsquo;s significance, history, and meaning, in its historical context;\n How to think about the transmission and attempted restriction of knowledge in different technological platforms (manuscripts, printed books, digital media)\n How to build an exhibit around objects and their history;\n What metadata is, and why metadata matters\n What Omeka is, and what content management systems are\n How to create your own Omeka site: building items, creating digital collections and building exhibits featuring scholarly materials\n  What You Hand In:  A proposal describing, in 200 words or fewer, the object whose story you plan to tell: what it is; why it was banned, by whom, and in what historical context; and how you plan to shape your exhibit. Due 06/05\n An annotated bibliography (http://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/types-of-writing/annotated-bibliography/) that contains: links to and descriptions of at least 3 things for your collection; references to and summaries of at least 3 scholarly sources (scholarly print books, scholarly journal articles, scholarly encyclopedia entries). Due 06/17\n A complete digital exhibit website that contains your collection of objects and a narrative about that collection. For reference, a former student\u0026rsquo;s UofT Library Research Prize-winning example of such a digital exhibit is d:escribed in detail here Jaya Thirugnanasampanthan\u0026rsquo;s exhibit on Thirteen Reasons Why\u0026rsquo;s banning in the U.S. (you will have to click through a bit to find a link to a walkthrough of the site).\n  Proposal 100-200 words: describe your book and the structure of your exhibit.\nSample Proposal\n   Example Discussion     My exhibit focuses on Ana Blandiana\u0026rsquo;s Întâmplări de pe strada mea One sentence identifying your object and   (‘Events From My Street\u0026rsquo;), a Romanian children\u0026rsquo;s book, which was banned its place/time of origin.   in Romania during the Ceaușescu regime.        I will discuss this book from the following points of view: An overview of your exhibit: its sections    and some of its objects.       Book I will describe the book itself, published in 1988 and banned Describe the book itself.   shortly afterwards.                    Ban or Challenge. I discuss why the book was scrutinized by the You will probably have less to say in your   Communist regime. Some items here include: photos of the pages with the proposal: that is FINE. Indicate who banned   poem “A star on my street,” a poem about a boastful kitten which was the bool, and why, and how your exhibit will   interpreted as a criticism of the dictator Ceausescu and caused the show this.   book to be scrutinized by the Securitate (the secret police); archival    photos of schoolchildren forced to celebrate Ceausescu; and children\u0026rsquo;s    textbooks featuring first-page photographs of Ceausescu. These    artifacts show how official culture sought to frame and control the    experience and knowledge of childhood.        Conclusion. I discuss children\u0026rsquo;s literature in Communist Romania as    a space in which writers dared to experiment, because children\u0026rsquo;s books    allowed writers to say uncomfortable things in playful or disguised    ways.            I contrast this with the ways the contemporary school system, in their    censorship of e.g. history books, competed to shape children\u0026rsquo;s worlds    and knowledge, selecting the literature and history curriculum to    reflect the ideology of the totalitarian government.         Collection 5 Items or more, to be described with Dublin Core metadata, including photos of your book:\nThe collection is a set of at least 5 items that document your book and the context in which it was banned. Photographs of the book should be taken by yourself; the other photographs, you may find on museum websites and cite properly.\nSome examples of objects that shed light on your book and the context in which your book was banned:\n If you are studying a book banned in Nazi Germany, find digitized archival photographs documenting e.g. book burnings in Nazi Germany;\n If you are studying a book banned by the Catholic Church, photograph the Index;\n If you are studying, say, Darwin\u0026rsquo;s Origin of Species, you can document its impact with photos of 19th century newspaper articles about it\u0026hellip;or with 21st century newspaper articles on the controversy around the depiction and teaching of evolution vs. creationism in U.S. schools\n If you are studying a science book, you can illustrate the science of the day with museum pictures of relevant scientific instruments (microscopes, telescopes);\n If you are studying a book of saints\u0026rsquo; lives (banned by Protestants) or a theological work (attacking the Catholic Church), you may look for contemporary images of e.g. book burnings, anti-Papal posters, etc.\n  Exhibit In every exhibit, at least four sections are mandatory: Introduction; Book; Context; and Insights. You may include other sections if needed.\nIntroduction This section is a summary of your exhibit, indicating what your book is, when it was banned, and why. 100-150 words. (A cleaned-up version of your proposal.)\nBook In this section, you describe your book and its author. What is its title? Who is its author? In detail and in your own words, summarize what the book is about. (size; shape; damage; marginal annotations, if any; illustrations, if any; other distinguishing marks, if any.) Your items in this section can be different photos of your book. Include as much descriptive detail as you can.\nContext In this section, you describe the social and historical context of your book: that is, the book\u0026rsquo;s time, place, and purpose. When and where was it written? What text technologies were involved in its creation? To what effect? Who was its intended audience? Why is the book in danger? If it is a banned or censored book, then who banned or challenged the book, and why? How was this censorship or challenge enforced? Your exhibit items can include maps, photographs of people reading the book, photographs of people destroying the book, recordings, etc.\nInsights What insights (specific to your book\u0026mdash;not a general conclusion that almost any other banned or endangered book could illustrate) into text technologies and the transmission of knowledge would you like your viewer to draw from your exhibit?\nMore specifically: how do the cultural and technical conditions in which the book was produced affect its endangerment and its afterlife? And how does the digital exhibit help you reflect on the text culture of your book?\nDraw on the scholarly readings of this course, from Alan Liu to Bethany Nowviskie, to discuss the “new media encounter” moment between the endangered book and your presentation of it in a digital medium. (Some things to think about: textual stability, deformance, sustainability, new media encounters, deep time\u0026hellip;)\nWorks Cited This section contains resources\u0026mdash;scholarly articles or museum articles or books\u0026mdash;on which your exhibit draws. You may use any scholarly citation style you like, as long as you are consistent.\nExample:\nGogata, Cristina. “Parallel Libraries Of The Former Securitate. Ana Blandiana, ‘Intamplari De Pe Strada Mea\u0026rsquo; (‘Events From My Street\u0026rsquo;).” Studia Universitatis Babes-Bolyai. 61(2): 2006, pp. 97-100.\nHappy researching!\nBooks You will select the book from the list below.

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Your first assignment is to profile a Digital Humanities project, analyzing its research aims, its form and content, its interface, technologies, and intended audience. You will learn how to navigate Digital Humanities projects, how to identify and evaluate different aspects of such projects, and how to analyze the kinds of knowledge and digital artifacts generated by DH projects. Write-up: 500 words plus screenshots.\nYou may select any project you like from the syllabus or from one of the pages below:\n https://digitalhumanities.duke.edu/all-projects (please start here) https://eadh.org/projects https://cdh.unc.edu/prsp-template/proj%5Finit/ https://dhcommons.org/projects (Oops! Down right now!)  This project profile is not an essay; it is a short, 1-2 page report. You do not need to write a formal introduction, thesis, argument, or conclusion. You should only report on your observations, using the questions below as categories of analysis, each with its own heading. Not all categories and questions apply to all projects, so do not feel obligated to respond to all of them. Your project profile will be evaluated for accuracy, clarity, detail, quality of analysis, and insight.\n Project: What is the name of the project? Who are its primary authors?\n Topic: What is the project about? (Examples: What topic and historical period does it focus on? What texts or art works or other material does it collect, explain, map, or analyze? What questions is the project seeking to answer?)\n People \u0026amp; Institutions: Who is the project leader? Who are their collaborators? What is the institution involved in the project\u0026rsquo;s development? What are the granting bodies funding the projects? Is credit given to individual contributors? To what extent?\n Presentation \u0026amp; User Experience: What is the “digital artifact” through which this project communicates its findings? A book? A game? A map? An edition? An archive? A tool? Another type of digital artifact?\nAs a user external to the project, what steps did you take to explore the project? Can you understand how to read the project\u0026rsquo;s data or how to use the tools it is building? As you explore the project, what do you find easy? What do you find difficult? What do you like? What do you dislike? Document your experience with screenshots, please (firefox\u0026rsquo;s screenshot tool makes this very easy).\nDoes this project provide access to users with e.g. limited bandwidth, minimal computing (e.g. smartphones instead of laptops), vision or hearing or tactile impairment?\n Data: What data does the project generate? What data format(s): text files, pdf files, digital images, databases, Excel or .csv files? Does the project provide narrative context for its data (that is, does it clearly explain what its data means and why it matters, for readers not familiar with the project)? Is access to project data open, subscription-only, or under a specific licence? May other scholars download the project\u0026rsquo;s data?\n Technologies: What technologies (encoding formats, digital publication platforms, software) are used in this project or built as part of this project? Are these technologies open-source, open-access?\n Audience: Who is the intended audience for this project? That is, does this project primarily speak to laypeople? Scholars? Specialists? How can you tell?\n Limitations: Does the project make note of any limitations in its work, any gaps or uncertainties in its data? Can you find limitations in its work\u0026mdash;that is, gaps between its stated goals and its results?\n  This assignment is based on the DMP Tool, the U of T DH Census Profile tool, and Kristen Mapes\u0026rsquo; DH Project Critique assignment.\n"

Ten years ago, I had to travel to the British Library to work with their medieval manuscripts. (Incidentally, I still have the sketches I made of their illumination. In pencil, because you can\u0026rsquo;t take pens into the reading room.) I got to handle a fourteenth-century manuscript, its parchment pages as supple, its illuminations as vivid as the day the book was scribed. I sat in the special collections library for seven hours. I looked at the illuminations; I handled the parchment, noting the differences between hair side and flesh side (parchment is made of animal skin, so you can see which side faced the outside and which faced the inside of the animal). For days, my hands smelled like goat.  Now, I am able to access the images in the manuscript online\u0026#x2014;anytime, from my office at UofT.

They can be easily searched, shared, stored, accessed remotely\u0026#x2026; But they lack the affordances that really matter to a group of people working together.      Users, Readers, Communities   Technology-in-practice (Wanda Orlikowski)   The notion of “technology-in-practice” suggests that the technology is not just the machinery, digital or analog, but on the one hand the organizational or institutional culture around it, and on the other hand, the needs and practices of its user community. Organizational culture and user community create a “behavioural and interpretive template” for the use of a technology.  Technology-in-practice: not only the technology itself, but “the ways it is extended, adapted, used, and misused by a specific user community—whether by ignoring an entire set of functions, or by extending its functionality through plugins or customizations, or by using it for purposes never foreseen by its designers. More briefly, technology-in-practice is “what people actually do with the technological artifact in their recurrent, situated practices.”  (Orlikowski, Wanda J. “Using Technology and Constituting Structures: A Practice Lens for Studying Technology in Organizations.” Organization Science, vol. 11, no. 4, 2000, pp. 404–428.)

Technology-in-practice    Users and Intended Audiences   [E]ven doorknobs have politics in that they may be round, requiring a human hand to turn them, or shaped as levers, such that a person with a prosthetic limb or an armload of groceries with one free elbow can still successfully use them. This is more than simply a matter of utility. Both designs are political in that they presume and construct different kinds of worlds, with the round doorknob presuming a world in which everyone’s bodies are the same, and in which hands with opposable thumbs and sufficient grip strength are always available (Galey, Alan, and Stan Ruecker. “How a Prototype Argues.” Literary and Linguistic Computing 25.4 (2010): 405-24.

Smart? Clean? Messy?” (Christof Schöch) “Computationally tractable” (Miriam Posner)       Humanities Data:  What “counts” cannot necessarily be counted Data representation = interpretation:  The process of modelling and collecting our data is an interpretive process that is shaped by our choices re. what aspects of the data we model; by our research question, argument, perspective, discipline, social context, institutional context, tools available etc.    Humanities Data: Drucker  Sciences vs. humanities: “assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. [\u0026#x2026;] To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed.” (Johanna Drucker, “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display.”)   Humanities Data: Posner  It would be possible to enumerate all of the filmic conventions that recall the conventions of melodrama. Is there a villain? Is there a heroine? Are good and evil depicted in stark, black-and-white terms? You could even build a dataset like this and use it to show how film changed over time.      Title Year Virtuous Heroine Cruel Villain Terrible evil Heroine in peril Broad gestures   The Lonedale Operator 1911 x x x x x   Birth of a Nation 1915 x x x x x   Get Rick Quick 1912 x \u0026#xa0; \u0026#xa0; \u0026#xa0; x     But, seriously, who cares? There’s just such a drastic difference between the richness of the actual film and the data we’re able to capture about it.  Humanities Data: Posner  “When you call something data, you imply that it exists in discrete, fungible units; that it is computationally tractable; that its meaningful qualities can be enumerated in a finite list; that someone else performing the same operations on the same data will come up with the same results.

For example, think about your library\u0026rsquo;s online catalogue: it contains the records of books, with fields like Author, Title, Publisher, Editor, Date. If you use standard metadata schemas, like Dublin Core, MARC, or MODS, your data will be discoverable and interoperable with aggregators and library catalogues.   Oops!

For example, for medieval manuscripts, you can list authors of the texts under Author: but what of known scribes, who may have also intervened in the text? Are they Authors or Publishers or Contributors? Pick what makes sense and apply it consistently. For details on Dublin Core : http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ If you wish the Item to be visible on the public view of the site, check “Public\u0026ldquo; (under “Add Item\u0026rdquo;). Click “Add Item\u0026ldquo; (green, right).   Add an item: Dublin Core Metadata  In this assignment, you are responsible for the following fields (and some may have to stay blank): Title; Description (a paragraph recording your description of the object, in your own words: 100-200 words) Creator; Source (can be e.g. manuscript or book or collection); Publisher; Date; Rights (i.e. who owns copyright \u0026#x2013; language here will vary strongly depending on institution the items come from, and that is not an error on the students\u0026rsquo; part); Format material, e.g. bronze, parchment, etc.); Language; Coverage (place where the object is from/was made).

Add an Exhibit: Plan  The Exhibit is a narrative pathway through the collection; or, if you will, a digital essay based on the items in your collection. First write the prose for your exhibit and decide what items need to appear in it. To look pretty in the Exhibit, the items need to have picture or video files attached. Save your prose in a separate file. Put your immortal prose somewhere safe. Omeka Exhibits cannot be exported automatically: and if you ever delete yours in error, there is no getting it back.   Add an Exhibit: Structure  An Omeka Exhibit has:  An overview page: displays an abstract (summary) of your exhibit Pages: sections of your exhibit; these display text as well as items (remember, to look pretty, the items need to have files attached) In each Page: blocks Pages are about content; Blocks are about layout/format   You get to decide the content and layout of your pages.    Add an Exhibit: Creation   Go to the Dashboard and click on Exhibits. Click Add an Exhibit.     Add an Exhibit: Metadata   Every Exhibit has metadata. Title displays as the Exhibits title. Slug forms the URL. Description is an abstract of the Exhibit that appears on its first page.     Add an Exhibit: Structure  The Exhibit consists of Pages. Each Page is a section of your Exhibit. To build your Exhibit, start adding Pages by clicking the Add Page green button.   Add an Exhibit: Pages  Each Page may consist of multiple blocks:  Text and an item block A gallery of items block Text block   To create a new Block, click on the desired layout. This block will be added as a section of this page. Your page can contain as many blocks as you like; you can drag them around to rearrange them.    Add an Exhibit: Blocks   Once you have added your narrative and selected your Items, your block will look like this: To see what the Page actually looks like, select the View Public Page button (right side of browser, in line with Content).     Add an Exhibit: Overall Design  In your finished Exhibit, each Page will be a Section of the Narrative, illustrated with Items from your digital collection. You can use and reuse items from your collection in as many Exhibits as you wish.     Building an Omeka Site: Conclusions  Make a project plan with deadlines. But allow for disasters. Plan your exhibits (possibly on paper) well ahead of time Draft and save your Item descriptions and your Exhibit content in word processing software; save this draft; Paste your content from Word into Omeka.         // Full list of configuration options available here: // https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#configuration Reveal.initialize({ controls: true, progress: true, history: true, center: false, slideNumber: 'c', rollingLinks: false, keyboard: true, mouseWheel: false, fragmentInURL: false, pdfSeparateFragments: true, overview: true, width: \"100%\", height: \"100%\", margin: 0.10, minScale: 1.00, maxScale: 1.00, theme: Reveal.getQueryHash().theme, // available themes are in /css/theme transition: Reveal.getQueryHash().transition || 'convex', // see README of reveal.js for options transitionSpeed: 'default', // Optional libraries used to extend on reveal.js dependencies: [ {src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/klipse_reveal.js'}, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//lib/js/classList.js', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/markdown/marked.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/markdown/markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/highlight/highlight.js', async: true, callback: function() { hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/notes/notes.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } }] });    "

[\u0026#x2026;] To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed.\u0026ldquo; Johanna Drucker, “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display.\u0026rdquo;   Display as Argument: Visual Knowledge Creation  Data vs. Capta Display as argument:    \u0026ldquo;Graphic artifacts present knowledge through the combination of symbolic codes and structured relations of these elements in a flat field. […T]he forms that are generally used for the presentation of information can be understood and read as culturally coded expressions of knowledge with their own epistemological assumptions and historical lineage\u0026rdquo; (Drucker, “Graphesis: Visual Knowledge Production and Representation,\u0026ldquo; 2011).   Drucker\u0026rsquo;s Graphesis  Johanna Drucker: graphesis = “the field of knowledge production embodied in visual expressions \u0026#x2026; a visual epistemology\u0026ldquo; (Drucker, “Graphesis\u0026rdquo; 2011) Visual forms carry the assumptions and values of their fields of origin, and impose these assumptions and values on the data they present, whether these assumptions and values are appropriate to that data or not. As humanists, we ask ourselves: What arguments, values, and perspectives do visualizations encode and embody? What kind of knowledge do they produce? What field\u0026rsquo;s assumptions do they draw from?

When Jefferson was appointed Ambassador to France, he took Hemings with him to Paris, and there apprenticed him to the chef of a prince. Through the few archival records that relate to Hemings, we also know, for instance, that while in Paris, Hemings hired his own tutor and learned to speak fluent French. And here\u0026rsquo;s another thing Hemings learned in Paris: what it might mean to be free. [\u0026#x2026;]  It is then a striking instantiation of archival silence that when you perform a \u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo; search for a person named James Hemings in the The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Digital Edition, you get no results\u0026#x2014;because Hemings, in spite of his ability to read and write in two languages\u0026#x2013;because of his status as a slave\u0026#x2013;was not a person to whom Jefferson ever wrote, or from whom Jefferson received letters.\u0026ldquo;    Mapping Imaginary Spaces    Non-Linear Timelines  Figure 18: \u0026ldquo;an interactive, tactile laboratory for exploring the historical relationship between freedom and confinement in the geographic area of the United States\u0026rdquo; (http://knottedline.com/)   Rewriting John Snow  Figure 19: Dr. John Snow\u0026rsquo;s visualization of cholera deaths in London, 1854.

Then give a graphical expression to the shape of the terrain, that urban streetscape, as it is redrawn to express the emotional landscape.

Some Rules of Thumb  in general, creative relationships to data/capta are more work than rigourous but straightforward quantitative analysis they require familiarity both both humanities concepts and the underlying technologies humaniites tools, though, try to lower the barrier to entry and so often hide the underlying technology. this lets you play with visualization but is rarely sufficient to bring rela insights and creative accomplishments     Data Visualization: Play Time  we have 3 texts: Lady Susan,, Frankenstein, and Les Misérables for each of these there is also a processed data file and in 2 cases a project file we will deal with them in 3 tools: Cytoscape (demo only), Palladio, and voyant Tools   Cytoscape  original data in lesmis.txt project file (if you want to replicate) in lesmis.cys   Maps \u0026amp; Networks with Palladio     Text Visualization with Voyant Tools  full-text visualization tool try with frankenstein.txt, *         // Full list of configuration options available here: // https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#configuration Reveal.initialize({ controls: true, progress: true, history: true, center: false, slideNumber: 'c', rollingLinks: false, keyboard: true, mouseWheel: false, fragmentInURL: false, pdfSeparateFragments: true, overview: true, width: \"100%\", height: \"100%\", margin: 0.10, minScale: 1.00, maxScale: 1.00, theme: Reveal.getQueryHash().theme, // available themes are in /css/theme transition: Reveal.getQueryHash().transition || 'convex', // see README of reveal.js for options transitionSpeed: 'default', // Optional libraries used to extend on reveal.js dependencies: [ {src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/klipse_reveal.js'}, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//lib/js/classList.js', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/markdown/marked.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/markdown/markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/highlight/highlight.js', async: true, callback: function() { hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/notes/notes.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } }] });    "

DH studies human culture \u0026ndash; art, literature, history, geography, religion \u0026ndash; through computational tools and methodologies; and, in turn, DH studies digital artifacts through humanist lenses, as complex cultural objects shaped by wider social, political, and philosophical concerns. Digital humanists analyze languages through digital text collections; build digital archives of forbidden books; construct video games to study literature; or resurrect historical cities through digital maps.\nThis summer, as in Fall 2018, the course focuses on endangered books: fragile, hidden, censored, forbidden. We speak to scholars who build archives of forbidden literature. We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. We study rare books\u0026rsquo; histories through digital exhibits. By the end of the course, you will have mastered concepts and technologies you can use in future courses and workplaces: text encoding and data visualization, data analysis and digital exhibit platforms. And you will learn how our stories and cultural conversations work and shapeshift through digital environments.\nLearning Goals By the end of the course:\n You will be able to describe the history and intellectual landscape of the digital humanities, including the central concepts, debates, projects, and digital tools current in the discipline. You will have developed a set of best practices around datasets, project design and management, and data curation. You will have analyzed data and digital artifacts as complex cultural objects, shaped by, and shaping, how we live, think, and know.  Through hands-on workshops:\n You will experiment with text encoding, quantitative text analysis, and text-based videogames as tools of scholarly research You will create and analyze data visualizations You will research and author your own digital exhibit  Course Readings \u0026amp; Technologies Course readings will be available either as links in the syllabus or via the course Quercus site each week. You are responsible for checking the Quercus site and ensuring you receive course announcements posted via Quercus.\nAll technologies used in this course are open-source or, in rare cases, licensed for use by U of T students. You will need access to a working computer to complete the work for this course.\nHow This Course Works Each week we have three hours of class, usually divided approximately as below:\n Two hours of lecture and discussion (classroom time); One hour of hands-on workshops and discussion (lab time).  Much of your course work will be done in class, in facilitated environments and hands-on workshops. Given the fast pace and praxis-oriented environment, you must come to class on time, all the time: it is all too easy, otherwise, to get lost. If this poses a problem, please let me know as soon as possible.\nAccessibility Students with diverse learning styles and needs are more than welcome in this course. Please feel free to approach me or Accessibility Services so we can assist you in achieving academic success in this course.\nSee A\u0026amp;S Accessibility Website for more details on the Accessibility policy.\nGrading Scheme    Assignment % Due Date     Participation 15 All semester; alternatives.

Assignments Reflection Portfolio You are responsible for writing three reflections in this course. Reflections include in-class digital artifacts as well as discussion of course readings. You will work on reflections in class as well as outside class, and you will hand them in via Quercus. They need not be perfect, just done. 400-500 words maximum.\nDH Project Profile Your first assignment is to profile a Digital Humanities project, analyzing its research aims, its form and content, its interface, technologies, and intended audience. 500-700 words. You will select the project from a sign-up list available via our course site.\nWorkshops Every week, you are also responsible for coming to the lab and undertaking the project or field trip of the week in a facilitated environment. This is where you can explore, experiment, fail creatively: all I require is engaged participation\u0026mdash;that is, you come to class, do the hands-on computer work, ask questions, and engage in class discussion.\nBook Project Your major assignment in this course is to tell the story of a banned, challenged, or endangered book through a digital exhibit.\nContact I love hearing from you! The best way to contact me is to talk to me in person in office hours. I also answer emails at matt.price@utoronto.ca within 48 hours or fewer on business days. However, I do not answer email after 5:00 p.m. or on weekends, and I do not expect you to do so, either. Please email me as soon as possible to make sure you receive your answers in good time.\nDue Dates \u0026amp; Late Penalties  Assignments Assignments are due at the beginning of each class. Late assignments will be penalized three percentage points per day unless you have prior permission from the instructor in writing (email). (Of course, late penalties do not apply when the lateness was caused by illness, bereavement, or other serious circumstances outside students\u0026rsquo; control. For religious observances, please notify instructor before the due date.) Lab Work If you miss a class, you are responsible for catching up with the work and will not receive credit for that class. (Of course, I will not penalize you if your absence is caused by illness, bereavement, religious observances, or other serious circumstances outside students\u0026rsquo; control.) Documentation needed for extensions As a matter of fairness to all students, you may be required to support any request for extensions or makeup test with supporting documentation. For medical issues, documentation consists of UofT\u0026rsquo;s Verification of Student Illness or Injury form. For non-medical issues, documentation consists of a note from the student\u0026rsquo;s College Registrar, social worker, clergy etc. Non-medical notes must contain the same information requested on U of T\u0026rsquo;s Verification of Student Illness or Injury form. Re-marking The deadline for requesting a re-marking is one week from the date the term work was made available for pickup. Unfortunately, I am unable to accept late re-marking requests.  Academic Integrity In this course, you will work with texts, objects, and digital artifacts. As you navigate the world of digital cultural heritage and write for a wider public, you are allowed (indeed, encouraged!) to use the work of others \u0026ndash; but you must carefully and conscientiously acknowledge your sources, give credit where credit is due, and respect the University of Toronto\u0026rsquo;s expectations of academic integrity.\nAcknowledgments This syllabus was originally written by Alexandra Bolintineanu, and draws on both Kristen Mapes\u0026rsquo; Introduction to Digital Humanities, AL285 and on Miriam Posner\u0026rsquo;s DH101: Introduction to Digital Humanities Fall 2014, UCLA.\nCourse Overview (Subject to Change) 1 (May. 06) Introduction to Digital Humanities What is “Digital Humanities”? We discuss the range of projects, activities, and concerns of this growing field, and collaboratively survey representative projects from around the world. We discuss DH in relation to the theme of the course, banned books.\nTool Workshop: Twine  How do digital media change possibilities for humanists to express themselves and craft persuasive arguments? We experiment via a popular game-design tool.  2 (May. 08) The Anatomy of DH Projects We discuss the components of digital humanities projects—data, code, tools, platforms, standards and communities of practice—as they manifest across a gallery of projects, living or dead. We investigate success, failure, and sustainability in DH projects. We collaboratively analyze two DH projects, peering “under the hood” of their technical framework and examining their research questions, digital artifacts, user experiences and intended audiences, and disciplinary implications.\nReadings and Discussion:  Miriam Posner, “How Did They Make That?” (2013) Alan Galey \u0026amp; Stan Ruecker, “How a Prototype Argues” (2010) (in-class discussion)  Reflection Handed Out: DH Project Profile Due May 13\n3 (May. 13) Endangered Knowledge 1: Rare Books \u0026amp; Digital Archives The first part of class is devoted to understanding the main course assignment, with some lecture material about endangered knowledge\nTools Workshop: Omeka A very brief intro to Omeka, the framework we\u0026rsquo;ll use to build your class projects.\nClass Outing: Banned and Censored Books We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library under the guidance of Tim Stinson, Cataloguer and Reference Librarian at the Library, and are introduced to the candidate books for your final projects.\nPlease Note: due to an unfortunate scheduling difficulty, our only window for this visit is 12:00-1:30 today. I am hopeful that everyone in the class can stay for this entire period.\n4 (May. 15) Digital Texts: Reading and Writing Endangered ‘book’: oral poetry, cultural memory\n Kinds of danger, types of responses Using digital methods to discover and highlight new understanding of literary texts  Readings \u0026amp; Discussion:  Lisa Samuels and Jerome J.

I\u0026rsquo;ll be away! You are free to use the classroom, though, to make progress on your work. We\u0026rsquo;ll discuss this more as the date gets closer.\n8 (May. 29) Data 2: Data Models for the Humanities We back up and ask: what are data models and algorithms? We discuss how data models, algorithms, and digital platforms inform ways of knowing, learning, and reading. Data as endangered/endangering knowledge.\nReadings \u0026amp; Discussion:  Miriam Posner, Humanities Data: A Necessary Contradiction (2015) Accessed April 30, 2019. Rob Kitchin, “Conceptualising Data.” The Data Revolution: Big Data, Open Data, Data Infrastructures \u0026amp; Their Consequences (2014)  Further Reading:  U of T\u0026rsquo;s research data management policies, including guidelines on handling sensitive data (including de-identification, i.e. anonymizing your data) and on Canadian funders\u0026rsquo; data publication requirements (two of the three federal funding bodies mandate that data created with gov\u0026rsquo;t funding be made public). Cathy O’Neil, Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy. (2016) Safiya Umoja Noble. Algorithms Of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism. (2018)  Reflection Assignment: Data Tool Comparison Reflection Due June 03\n9 (Jun. 03) Data Visualization In a facilitated workshop, we turn to data visualization of humanities materials, using Jane Austen’s Lady Susan for experimentation (Voyant, Palladio, Cytoscape, Tableau: text and corpus work, network graphs, mapping, annotation). Then we analyze the American Library Association’s data on banned books and discuss how we might model, interpret, question, and visualize this data.\nReadings \u0026amp; Discussion  Johanna Drucker, “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” Digital Humanities Quarterly (2011).

We\u0026rsquo;ll discuss how to use DH approaches and tools in your home disciplines. We also discuss how we might apply the course learning outcomes to jobs in the corporate sector: we dissect a job ad from Monster.ca to align students\u0026rsquo; newly acquired skills with every requirement of that position.\n"
