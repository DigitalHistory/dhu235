	"content": " As described in the syllabus, I use your participation mark to determine the \u0026ldquo;-/null/+\u0026rdquo; part of your grade. Let me explain a little more explicitly how this works.\nThe System It\u0026rsquo;s simple. Suppose you successfully complete the Git \u0026amp; Github, HTML \u0026amp; CSS, Javascript, Spatial History, and Oral History assignments. Congratulations! You have qualified for a B. But what kind of a B?\n   If your class participation was: You get a: Which ROSI will show as:     Poor B- 72   Satisfactory B 75   Excellent B+ 78    Similarly, perhaps you were only able to complete the Git \u0026amp; Github, HTML \u0026amp; CSS, Javascript and Oral History. Oops! You\u0026rsquo;re going to get a C. Like your somewhat happier classmate, your final grade will be assigned thus:\n   If your class participation was: You get a: Which ROSI will show as:     Poor C- 52   Satisfactory C 55   Excellent C+ 58    But Note!\nA+ is a special grade. Suppose you complete all the assignments satisfactorily, including the additional \u0026ldquo;A only\u0026rdquo; sections of the relevant assignments. Wow! You get an A, great. But\u0026hellip; do you get an A+?\n   If your class participation was: You get an: Which ROSI will show as:     Poor A- 83   Satisfactory A 88   Excellent DEPENDS DEPENDS    Even if your participation was excellent, you will only receive an A+ if your work was consistently excellent and occasionally brilliant. So, if you successfully complete all the assignments (great!), and also are a great class participant (thanks!), then I\u0026rsquo;ll look over all your work and make a value judgment about whether you deserve this rare and precious grade.\nFinal Note for 2018 \u0026ndash; this year, there isn\u0026rsquo;t really a \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; grade. To pass the course you basically have to get a C. In rare cases I will consider lowering the grading criteria for the \u0026ldquo;Oral History\u0026rdquo; assignment to permit a student to scrape through the course.\nParticipation Criteria Your participation mark is a combination of in-class and online participation.\nIn the Classroom But what makes for good class participation? You might want to start by reading How to discuss a book for history, which has lots of helpful suggestions. Really, please read it \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s illuminating. But, meanwhile, here are some hints:\n Show up for class: It\u0026rsquo;s hard to discuss when you\u0026rsquo;re not here. Do the Readings: It\u0026rsquo;s hard to discuss what you haven\u0026rsquo;t read. I will try hard not to assign too much reading; in return, please try to read it. Be Courteous: Treat your classmates with respect, even when your opinions differ fiercely. Refrain from interrupting others, notice when others have been waiting \u0026amp; let them speak first, and so on. Don\u0026rsquo;t shut other people down, and frame your comments in a way that invites further discussion. Listen: Pay careful attention when your classmates are speaking; if their ideas seem a little unclear, try to fill in the gaps, either by thinking silently, or by asking friendly, clarifying questions. Try to think about how their positions relate to yours, and, especially, whether you should perhaps change your mind a little based on what they have to say. Be Clear: think about the readings before you come to class, so that your opinions are well-formed. Be Brave: It can be intimidating to speak in class, especially if you have found the readings or the lecture confusing. But you will almost never be alone. If one person is confused, others likely are too. Have the courage to speak up \u0026ndash; everyone in the room is likely to thank you. If you are extremely shy in person, then come speak to me and we can try to work out a solution for you. Participate in Group work: Occasionally we will break up into small groups. The same princples apply to group work \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ll be paying attention.  Online Our Slack workspace is also a great way to participate. Contribute to the class in Slack by asking good questions, helping out your classmates, and correcting any professorial errors from lecture!\nFinally If you can do all of these things consistently, you\u0026rsquo;re likely to earn a \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo;. If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure how you\u0026rsquo;re doing, come ask me in a couple of weeks and I\u0026rsquo;ll give you some feedback.\n"

DH studies human culture \u0026ndash; art, literature, history, geography, religion \u0026ndash; through computational tools and methodologies; and, in turn, DH studies digital artifacts through humanist lenses, as complex cultural objects shaped by wider social, political, and philosophical concerns. Digital humanists analyze languages through digital text collections; build digital archives of forbidden books; construct video games to study literature; or resurrect historical cities through digital maps.\nThis summer, as in Fall 2018, the course focuses on endangered books: fragile, hidden, censored, forbidden. We speak to scholars who build archives of forbidden literature. We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. We study rare books\u0026rsquo; histories through digital exhibits. By the end of the course, you will have mastered concepts and technologies you can use in future courses and workplaces: text encoding and data visualization, data analysis and digital exhibit platforms. And you will learn how our stories and cultural conversations work and shapeshift through digital environments.\nLearning Goals By the end of the course:\n You will be able to describe the history and intellectual landscape of the digital humanities, including the central concepts, debates, projects, and digital tools current in the discipline. You will have developed a set of best practices around datasets, project design and management, and data curation. You will have analyzed data and digital artifacts as complex cultural objects, shaped by, and shaping, how we live, think, and know.  Through hands-on workshops:\n You will experiment with text encoding, quantitative text analysis, and text-based videogames as tools of scholarly research You will create and analyze data visualizations You will research and author your own digital exhibit  Course Readings \u0026amp; Technologies Course readings will be available either as links in the syllabus or via the course Quercus site each week. You are responsible for checking the Quercus site and ensuring you receive course announcements posted via Quercus.\nAll technologies used in this course are open-source or, in rare cases, licensed for use by U of T students. You will need access to a working computer to complete the work for this course.\nHow This Course Works Each week we have three hours of class, usually divided approximately as below:\n Two hours of lecture and discussion (classroom time); One hour of hands-on workshops and discussion (lab time).  Much of your course work will be done in class, in facilitated environments and hands-on workshops. Given the fast pace and praxis-oriented environment, you must come to class on time, all the time: it is all too easy, otherwise, to get lost. If this poses a problem, please let me know as soon as possible.\nAccessibility Students with diverse learning styles and needs are more than welcome in this course. Please feel free to approach me or Accessibility Services so we can assist you in achieving academic success in this course.\nSee A\u0026amp;S Accessibility Website for more details on the Accessibility policy.\nGrading Scheme    Assignment % Due Date     Participation 15 All semester; alternatives.   Reflection Portfolio (3) 45 May 13, May 22, June 03   Book Project: Consultation 2 May 22-June 03, in office hours or by appointment   Book Project: Proposal \u0026amp; Annotated Bibliography 3 June 05   Book Project: Digital Exhibit 35 June 17   Total 100      Reflections include in-class digital artifacts as well as discussion of course readings. You will work on reflections in class as well as outside class, and you will hand them in via Quercus. 400-500 words maximum.  Assignments Reflection Portfolio You are responsible for writing three reflections in this course. Reflections include in-class digital artifacts as well as discussion of course readings. You will work on reflections in class as well as outside class, and you will hand them in via Quercus. They need not be perfect, just done. 400-500 words maximum.\nDH Project Profile Your first assignment is to profile a Digital Humanities project, analyzing its research aims, its form and content, its interface, technologies, and intended audience. 500-700 words. You will select the project from a sign-up list available via our course site.\nWorkshops Every week, you are also responsible for coming to the lab and undertaking the project or field trip of the week in a facilitated environment. This is where you can explore, experiment, fail creatively: all I require is engaged participation\u0026mdash;that is, you come to class, do the hands-on computer work, ask questions, and engage in class discussion.\nBook Project Your major assignment in this course is to tell the story of a banned, challenged, or endangered book through a digital exhibit.\nContact I love hearing from you! The best way to contact me is to talk to me in person in office hours. I also answer emails at matt.price@utoronto.ca within 48 hours or fewer on business days. However, I do not answer email after 5:00 p.m. or on weekends, and I do not expect you to do so, either. Please email me as soon as possible to make sure you receive your answers in good time.\nDue Dates \u0026amp; Late Penalties  Assignments Assignments are due at the beginning of each class. Late assignments will be penalized three percentage points per day unless you have prior permission from the instructor in writing (email). (Of course, late penalties do not apply when the lateness was caused by illness, bereavement, or other serious circumstances outside students\u0026rsquo; control. For religious observances, please notify instructor before the due date.) Lab Work If you miss a class, you are responsible for catching up with the work and will not receive credit for that class. (Of course, I will not penalize you if your absence is caused by illness, bereavement, religious observances, or other serious circumstances outside students\u0026rsquo; control.) Documentation needed for extensions As a matter of fairness to all students, you may be required to support any request for extensions or makeup test with supporting documentation. For medical issues, documentation consists of UofT\u0026rsquo;s Verification of Student Illness or Injury form. For non-medical issues, documentation consists of a note from the student\u0026rsquo;s College Registrar, social worker, clergy etc. Non-medical notes must contain the same information requested on U of T\u0026rsquo;s Verification of Student Illness or Injury form. Re-marking The deadline for requesting a re-marking is one week from the date the term work was made available for pickup. Unfortunately, I am unable to accept late re-marking requests.  Academic Integrity In this course, you will work with texts, objects, and digital artifacts. As you navigate the world of digital cultural heritage and write for a wider public, you are allowed (indeed, encouraged!) to use the work of others \u0026ndash; but you must carefully and conscientiously acknowledge your sources, give credit where credit is due, and respect the University of Toronto\u0026rsquo;s expectations of academic integrity.\nAcknowledgments This syllabus was originally written by Alexandra Bolintineanu, and draws on both Kristen Mapes\u0026rsquo; Introduction to Digital Humanities, AL285 and on Miriam Posner\u0026rsquo;s DH101: Introduction to Digital Humanities Fall 2014, UCLA.\nCourse Overview (Subject to Change) 1 (May. 06) Introduction to Digital Humanities What is “Digital Humanities”? We discuss the range of projects, activities, and concerns of this growing field, and collaboratively survey representative projects from around the world. We discuss DH in relation to the theme of the course, banned books.\nTool Workshop: Twine  How do digital media change possibilities for humanists to express themselves and craft persuasive arguments? We experiment via a popular game-design tool.  2 (May. 08) The Anatomy of DH Projects We discuss the components of digital humanities projects—data, code, tools, platforms, standards and communities of practice—as they manifest across a gallery of projects, living or dead. We investigate success, failure, and sustainability in DH projects. We collaboratively analyze two DH projects, peering “under the hood” of their technical framework and examining their research questions, digital artifacts, user experiences and intended audiences, and disciplinary implications.\nReadings and Discussion:  Miriam Posner, “How Did They Make That?” (2013) Alan Galey \u0026amp; Stan Ruecker, “How a Prototype Argues” (2010) (in-class discussion)  Reflection Handed Out: DH Project Profile Due May 13\n3 (May. 13) Endangered Knowledge 1: Rare Books \u0026amp; Digital Archives The first part of class is devoted to understanding the main course assignment, with some lecture material about endangered knowledge\nTools Workshop: Omeka A very brief intro to Omeka, the framework we\u0026rsquo;ll use to build your class projects.\nClass Outing: Banned and Censored Books We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library under the guidance of Tim Stinson, Cataloguer and Reference Librarian at the Library, and are introduced to the candidate books for your final projects.\nPlease Note: due to an unfortunate scheduling difficulty, our only window for this visit is 12:00-1:30 today. I am hopeful that everyone in the class can stay for this entire period.\n4 (May. 15) Digital Texts: Reading and Writing Endangered ‘book’: oral poetry, cultural memory\n Kinds of danger, types of responses Using digital methods to discover and highlight new understanding of literary texts  Readings \u0026amp; Discussion:  Lisa Samuels and Jerome J.

We experiment with text encoding using  Reflection 2 Due May 22\n5 (May. 20) NO CLASS VICTORIA DAY 6 (May. 22) Data: OpenRefine  A special 3-hour workshop with OpenRefine in the Map and Data Library (5th Floor Robarts)  Data \u0026amp; Map Workshop with Kelly Schultz Introduction to data cleaning with OpenRefine, a powerful data cleaning and transformation tool.\n7 (May. 27) NO CLASS TEACHER ABSENT! 8 (May. 29) Data 2: Data Models for the Humanities We back up and ask: what are data models and algorithms? We discuss how data models, algorithms, and digital platforms inform ways of knowing, learning, and reading. Data as endangered/endangering knowledge.\nReadings \u0026amp; Discussion:  Miriam Posner, Humanities Data: A Necessary Contradiction (2015) Accessed April 30, 2019. Rob Kitchin, “Conceptualising Data.” The Data Revolution: Big Data, Open Data, Data Infrastructures \u0026amp; Their Consequences (2014)  Further Reading:  U of T\u0026rsquo;s research data management policies, including guidelines on handling sensitive data (including de-identification, i.e. anonymizing your data) and on Canadian funders\u0026rsquo; data publication requirements (two of the three federal funding bodies mandate that data created with gov\u0026rsquo;t funding be made public). Cathy O’Neil, Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy. (2016) Safiya Umoja Noble. Algorithms Of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism. (2018)  Reflection Assignment: Data Tool Comparison Reflection Due June 03\n9 (Jun. 03) Endangered Knowledge 2: Theory and Practice We examine digital archives, discussing creation, preservation, ethical concerns, relationships with communities, and security and environmental issues raised by cloud computing and machine learning. We examine UofT’s guidelines around the ethical and technical management of human research data.\nReadings \u0026amp; Discussion On Resurrections, Risks, Losses William Noel, “Revealing the Lost Codex of Archimedes” (2012).

Prof. Alexandra Bolintineanu will share some reflections on Samizdat and censorship in late Twentieth Century Romania.\n11 (Jun. 10) Data Visualization In facilitated workshops, we turn to data visualization of humanities materials, using Jane Austen’s Lady Susan for experimentation (Voyant, Palladio, Cytoscape, Tableau: text and corpus work, network graphs, mapping, annotation). Then we analyze the American Library Association’s data on banned books and discuss how we might model, interpret, question, and visualize this data.\nReadings \u0026amp; Discussion  Johanna Drucker, “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” Digital Humanities Quarterly (2011). Miriam Posner, Data Trouble: Why Humanists Have Problems with Datavis, and Why Anyone Should Care (2016)  12 (Jun. 12) DV 2 Continuation of previous Session\n13 (Jun. 17) Retrospective The last class is a retrospective look at the course. We\u0026rsquo;ll discuss how to use DH approaches and tools in your home disciplines. We also discuss how we might apply the course learning outcomes to jobs in the corporate sector: we dissect a job ad from Monster.ca to align students\u0026rsquo; newly acquired skills with every requirement of that position.\ntest\n"
