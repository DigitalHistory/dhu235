	"content": " ## Overview {#overview} In this assignment, you get to tell the story of a banned book you have seen in person, either from the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library or from our list. You will create a website that features a digital collection and exhibit about that book, using the free, open-source content management platform Omeka. Like a good museum curator, you will bring together a gallery of exciting pictures, and you will guide your visitors through that gallery through a well-researched, interesting narrative about your book. - Your digital collection will catalogue evidence about your book: photographs of the book itself (title page, illustrations, marginal annotations, damage, other interesting features); images of related books from other museums; manuscript illuminations; other relevant multimedia. Each object of your digital collection will be described systematically, as books are described in a library catalogue. - Your exhibit will be a guided tour about your book and the circumstances under which it was banned. - You will use some digital technology as part of this assignment. This is a scaffolded assignment: that is, you will produce several components at each stage, and each component builds on the ones before it-- like LEGO, except you get to build your own bricks.   ## Learning Goals {#learning-goals} By the end of this learning module, you will have learned: - How to understand your book's significance, history, and meaning, in its historical context; - How to think about the transmission and attempted restriction of knowledge in different technological platforms (manuscripts, printed books, digital media) - How to build an exhibit around objects and their history; - What metadata is, and why metadata matters - What Omeka is, and what content management systems are - How to create your own Omeka site: building items, creating digital collections and building exhibits featuring scholarly materials   ## What You Hand In: {#what-you-hand-in} 1. A proposal describing, in 200 words or fewer, the object whose story you plan to tell: what it is; why it was banned, by whom, and in what historical context; and how you plan to shape your exhibit. **Due 06/05** 2. An annotated bibliography () that contains: links to and descriptions of at least 3 things for your collection; references to and summaries of at least 3 **scholarly** sources (scholarly print books, scholarly journal articles, scholarly encyclopedia entries). **Due 06/17** 3. A complete digital exhibit website that contains your collection of objects and a narrative about that collection. For reference, a former student's UofT Library Research Prize-winning example of such a digital exhibit is d:escribed in detail here [Jaya Thirugnanasampanthan's exhibit on _Thirteen Reasons Why_'s banning in the U.S.](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/88308) (you will have to click through a bit to find [a link to a walkthrough of the site](https://play.library.utoronto.ca/download/XPYcIMVV80N4)).   ## Proposal {#proposal} **100-200 words**: describe your book and the structure of your exhibit. **Sample Proposal** | **Example** | **Discussion** | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------| | My exhibit focuses on Ana Blandiana's _Întâmplări de pe strada mea_ | One sentence identifying your object and | | (‘Events From My Street'), a Romanian children's book, which was banned | its place/time of origin. | | in Romania during the Ceaușescu regime. | | | | | | I will discuss this book from the following points of view: | An overview of your exhibit: its sections | | | and some of its objects. | | | | | **Book** I will describe the book itself, published in 1988 and banned | Describe the book itself. | | shortly afterwards. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | **Ban or Challenge**.

These | | | artifacts show how official culture sought to frame and control the | | | experience and knowledge of childhood. | | | | | | **Conclusion.** I discuss children's literature in Communist Romania as | | | a space in which writers dared to experiment, because children's books | | | allowed writers to say uncomfortable things in playful or disguised | | | ways. | | | | | | | | | I contrast this with the ways the contemporary school system, in their | | | censorship of e.g. history books, competed to shape children's worlds | | | and knowledge, selecting the literature and history curriculum to | | | reflect the ideology of the totalitarian government. | | | | |   ## Collection {#collection} **5 Items or more, to be described with Dublin Core metadata, including photos of your book:** The collection is a set of at least 5 items that document your book and the context in which it was banned. Photographs of the book should be taken by yourself; the other photographs, you may find on museum websites and cite properly. Some examples of objects that shed light on your book and the context in which your book was banned: - If you are studying a book banned in Nazi Germany, find digitized archival photographs documenting e.g. book burnings in Nazi Germany; - If you are studying a book banned by the Catholic Church, photograph the Index; - If you are studying, say, Darwin's _Origin of Species_, you can document its impact with photos of 19th century newspaper articles about it...or with 21st century newspaper articles on the controversy around the depiction and teaching of evolution vs. creationism in U.S. schools - If you are studying a science book, you can illustrate the science of the day with museum pictures of relevant scientific instruments (microscopes, telescopes); - If you are studying a book of saints' lives (banned by Protestants) or a theological work (attacking the Catholic Church), you may look for contemporary images of e.g. book burnings, anti-Papal posters, etc.   ## Exhibit {#exhibit} In every exhibit, at least four sections are mandatory: **Introduction**; **_Book_**; **Context**; and **Insights**. You may include other sections if needed.  ### Introduction {#introduction} This section is a summary of your exhibit, indicating what your book is, when it was banned, and why. 100-150 words. (A cleaned-up version of your proposal.)   ### Book {#book} In this section, you describe your book and its author. What is its title? Who is its author? In detail and in your own words, summarize what the book is about. (size; shape; damage; marginal annotations, if any; illustrations, if any; other distinguishing marks, if any.) Your items in this section can be different photos of your book. Include as much descriptive detail as you can.   ### Context {#context} In this section, you describe the social and historical context of your book: that is, the book's **time**, **place**, and **purpose**. When and where was it written? What text technologies were involved in its creation? To what effect? Who was its intended audience? Why is the book in danger? If it is a banned or censored book, then who banned or challenged the book, and why? How was this censorship or challenge enforced? Your exhibit items can include maps, photographs of people reading the book, photographs of people destroying the book, recordings, etc.   ### Insights {#insights} What insights (specific to your book---not a general conclusion that almost any other banned or endangered book could illustrate) into text technologies and the transmission of knowledge would you like your viewer to draw from your exhibit? More specifically: how do the cultural and technical conditions in which the book was produced affect its endangerment and its afterlife? And how does the digital exhibit help you reflect on the text culture of your book? Draw on the scholarly readings of this course, from Alan Liu to Bethany Nowviskie, to discuss the “new media encounter” moment between the endangered book and your presentation of it in a digital medium. (Some things to think about: textual stability, deformance, sustainability, new media encounters, deep time...)   ### Works Cited {#works-cited} This section contains resources---scholarly articles or museum articles or books---on which your exhibit draws. You may use any scholarly citation style you like, as long as you are consistent. Example: Gogata, Cristina. “Parallel Libraries Of The Former Securitate. Ana Blandiana, ‘Intamplari De Pe Strada Mea' (‘Events From My Street').” Studia Universitatis Babes-Bolyai. 61(2): 2006, pp. 97-100. _Happy researching!_  \n ## Books {#books} You will select the book from the list below.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Your first assignment is to profile a Digital Humanities project, analyzing its research aims, its form and content, its interface, technologies, and intended audience. You will learn how to navigate Digital Humanities projects, how to identify and evaluate different aspects of such projects, and how to analyze the kinds of knowledge and digital artifacts generated by DH projects. Write-up: 500 words plus screenshots.\nYou may select any project you like from the syllabus or from one of the pages below:\n https://digitalhumanities.duke.edu/all-projects (please start here) https://eadh.org/projects https://cdh.unc.edu/prsp-template/proj%5Finit/ https://dhcommons.org/projects (Oops! Down right now!)  This project profile is not an essay; it is a short, 1-2 page report. You do not need to write a formal introduction, thesis, argument, or conclusion. You should only report on your observations, using the questions below as categories of analysis, each with its own heading. Not all categories and questions apply to all projects, so do not feel obligated to respond to all of them. Your project profile will be evaluated for accuracy, clarity, detail, quality of analysis, and insight.\n Project: What is the name of the project? Who are its primary authors?\n Topic: What is the project about? (Examples: What topic and historical period does it focus on? What texts or art works or other material does it collect, explain, map, or analyze? What questions is the project seeking to answer?)\n People \u0026amp; Institutions: Who is the project leader? Who are their collaborators? What is the institution involved in the project\u0026rsquo;s development? What are the granting bodies funding the projects? Is credit given to individual contributors? To what extent?\n Presentation \u0026amp; User Experience: What is the “digital artifact” through which this project communicates its findings? A book? A game? A map? An edition? An archive? A tool? Another type of digital artifact?\nAs a user external to the project, what steps did you take to explore the project? Can you understand how to read the project\u0026rsquo;s data or how to use the tools it is building? As you explore the project, what do you find easy? What do you find difficult? What do you like? What do you dislike? Document your experience with screenshots, please (firefox\u0026rsquo;s screenshot tool makes this very easy).\nDoes this project provide access to users with e.g. limited bandwidth, minimal computing (e.g. smartphones instead of laptops), vision or hearing or tactile impairment?\n Data: What data does the project generate? What data format(s): text files, pdf files, digital images, databases, Excel or .csv files? Does the project provide narrative context for its data (that is, does it clearly explain what its data means and why it matters, for readers not familiar with the project)? Is access to project data open, subscription-only, or under a specific licence? May other scholars download the project\u0026rsquo;s data?\n Technologies: What technologies (encoding formats, digital publication platforms, software) are used in this project or built as part of this project? Are these technologies open-source, open-access?\n Audience: Who is the intended audience for this project? That is, does this project primarily speak to laypeople? Scholars? Specialists? How can you tell?\n Limitations: Does the project make note of any limitations in its work, any gaps or uncertainties in its data? Can you find limitations in its work\u0026mdash;that is, gaps between its stated goals and its results?\n  This assignment is based on the DMP Tool, the U of T DH Census Profile tool, and Kristen Mapes\u0026rsquo; DH Project Critique assignment.\n"

Ten years ago, I had to travel to the British Library to work with their medieval manuscripts. (Incidentally, I still have the sketches I made of their illumination. In pencil, because you can\u0026rsquo;t take pens into the reading room.) I got to handle a fourteenth-century manuscript, its parchment pages as supple, its illuminations as vivid as the day the book was scribed. I sat in the special collections library for seven hours. I looked at the illuminations; I handled the parchment, noting the differences between hair side and flesh side (parchment is made of animal skin, so you can see which side faced the outside and which faced the inside of the animal). For days, my hands smelled like goat.  Now, I am able to access the images in the manuscript online\u0026#x2014;anytime, from my office at UofT. I can compare the images to other manuscripts of the Book of John Mandeville. I can study them, annotate them, put them in Powerpoints, and reference them robustly in scholarly arguments.

For days, my hands smelled like goat.  Now, I am able to access the images in the manuscript online\u0026#x2014;anytime, from my office at UofT. I can compare the images to other manuscripts of the Book of John Mandeville. I can study them, annotate them, put them in Powerpoints, and reference them robustly in scholarly arguments.

Users, Readers, Communities   Technology-in-practice (Wanda Orlikowski)   The notion of “technology-in-practice” suggests that the technology is not just the machinery, digital or analog, but on the one hand the organizational or institutional culture around it, and on the other hand, the needs and practices of its user community. Organizational culture and user community create a “behavioural and interpretive template” for the use of a technology.  Technology-in-practice: not only the technology itself, but “the ways it is extended, adapted, used, and misused by a specific user community—whether by ignoring an entire set of functions, or by extending its functionality through plugins or customizations, or by using it for purposes never foreseen by its designers. More briefly, technology-in-practice is “what people actually do with the technological artifact in their recurrent, situated practices.”  (Orlikowski, Wanda J. “Using Technology and Constituting Structures: A Practice Lens for Studying Technology in Organizations.” Organization Science, vol. 11, no. 4, 2000, pp. 404–428.)

Smart? Clean? Messy?” (Christof Schöch) “Computationally tractable” (Miriam Posner)       Humanities Data:  What “counts” cannot necessarily be counted Data representation = interpretation:  The process of modelling and collecting our data is an interpretive process that is shaped by our choices re. what aspects of the data we model; by our research question, argument, perspective, discipline, social context, institutional context, tools available etc.    Humanities Data: Drucker  Sciences vs. humanities: “assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. [\u0026#x2026;] To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed.” (Johanna Drucker, “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display.”)   Humanities Data: Posner  It would be possible to enumerate all of the filmic conventions that recall the conventions of melodrama. Is there a villain? Is there a heroine? Are good and evil depicted in stark, black-and-white terms? You could even build a dataset like this and use it to show how film changed over time.

There’s just such a drastic difference between the richness of the actual film and the data we’re able to capture about it.  Humanities Data: Posner  “When you call something data, you imply that it exists in discrete, fungible units; that it is computationally tractable; that its meaningful qualities can be enumerated in a finite list; that someone else performing the same operations on the same data will come up with the same results. This is not how humanists think of the material they work with.” (http://miriamposner.com/blog/humanities-data-a-necessary-contradiction/)   Humanities\u0026rsquo; Data   Humanities data has depth in small universes.

DH studies human culture \u0026ndash; art, literature, history, geography, religion \u0026ndash; through computational tools and methodologies; and, in turn, DH studies digital artifacts through humanist lenses, as complex cultural objects shaped by wider social, political, and philosophical concerns. Digital humanists analyze languages through digital text collections; build digital archives of forbidden books; construct video games to study literature; or resurrect historical cities through digital maps.\nThis summer, as in Fall 2018, the course focuses on endangered books: fragile, hidden, censored, forbidden. We speak to scholars who build archives of forbidden literature. We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. We study rare books\u0026rsquo; histories through digital exhibits. By the end of the course, you will have mastered concepts and technologies you can use in future courses and workplaces: text encoding and data visualization, data analysis and digital exhibit platforms. And you will learn how our stories and cultural conversations work and shapeshift through digital environments.\nLearning Goals By the end of the course:\n You will be able to describe the history and intellectual landscape of the digital humanities, including the central concepts, debates, projects, and digital tools current in the discipline. You will have developed a set of best practices around datasets, project design and management, and data curation. You will have analyzed data and digital artifacts as complex cultural objects, shaped by, and shaping, how we live, think, and know.  Through hands-on workshops:\n You will experiment with text encoding, quantitative text analysis, and text-based videogames as tools of scholarly research You will create and analyze data visualizations You will research and author your own digital exhibit  Course Readings \u0026amp; Technologies Course readings will be available either as links in the syllabus or via the course Quercus site each week. You are responsible for checking the Quercus site and ensuring you receive course announcements posted via Quercus.\nAll technologies used in this course are open-source or, in rare cases, licensed for use by U of T students. You will need access to a working computer to complete the work for this course.\nHow This Course Works Each week we have three hours of class, usually divided approximately as below:\n Two hours of lecture and discussion (classroom time); One hour of hands-on workshops and discussion (lab time).  Much of your course work will be done in class, in facilitated environments and hands-on workshops. Given the fast pace and praxis-oriented environment, you must come to class on time, all the time: it is all too easy, otherwise, to get lost. If this poses a problem, please let me know as soon as possible.\nAccessibility Students with diverse learning styles and needs are more than welcome in this course. Please feel free to approach me or Accessibility Services so we can assist you in achieving academic success in this course.\nSee A\u0026amp;S Accessibility Website for more details on the Accessibility policy.\nGrading Scheme    Assignment % Due Date     Participation 15 All semester; alternatives.   Reflection Portfolio (3) 45 May 13, May 22, June 03   Book Project: Consultation 2 May 22-June 03, in office hours or by appointment   Book Project: Proposal \u0026amp; Annotated Bibliography 3 June 05   Book Project: Digital Exhibit 35 June 17   Total 100      Reflections include in-class digital artifacts as well as discussion of course readings. You will work on reflections in class as well as outside class, and you will hand them in via Quercus. 400-500 words maximum.  Assignments Reflection Portfolio You are responsible for writing three reflections in this course. Reflections include in-class digital artifacts as well as discussion of course readings. You will work on reflections in class as well as outside class, and you will hand them in via Quercus. They need not be perfect, just done. 400-500 words maximum.\nDH Project Profile Your first assignment is to profile a Digital Humanities project, analyzing its research aims, its form and content, its interface, technologies, and intended audience. 500-700 words. You will select the project from a sign-up list available via our course site.\nWorkshops Every week, you are also responsible for coming to the lab and undertaking the project or field trip of the week in a facilitated environment. This is where you can explore, experiment, fail creatively: all I require is engaged participation\u0026mdash;that is, you come to class, do the hands-on computer work, ask questions, and engage in class discussion.\nBook Project Your major assignment in this course is to tell the story of a banned, challenged, or endangered book through a digital exhibit.\nContact I love hearing from you! The best way to contact me is to talk to me in person in office hours. I also answer emails at matt.price@utoronto.ca within 48 hours or fewer on business days. However, I do not answer email after 5:00 p.m. or on weekends, and I do not expect you to do so, either. Please email me as soon as possible to make sure you receive your answers in good time.\nDue Dates \u0026amp; Late Penalties  Assignments Assignments are due at the beginning of each class. Late assignments will be penalized three percentage points per day unless you have prior permission from the instructor in writing (email). (Of course, late penalties do not apply when the lateness was caused by illness, bereavement, or other serious circumstances outside students\u0026rsquo; control. For religious observances, please notify instructor before the due date.) Lab Work If you miss a class, you are responsible for catching up with the work and will not receive credit for that class. (Of course, I will not penalize you if your absence is caused by illness, bereavement, religious observances, or other serious circumstances outside students\u0026rsquo; control.) Documentation needed for extensions As a matter of fairness to all students, you may be required to support any request for extensions or makeup test with supporting documentation. For medical issues, documentation consists of UofT\u0026rsquo;s Verification of Student Illness or Injury form. For non-medical issues, documentation consists of a note from the student\u0026rsquo;s College Registrar, social worker, clergy etc. Non-medical notes must contain the same information requested on U of T\u0026rsquo;s Verification of Student Illness or Injury form. Re-marking The deadline for requesting a re-marking is one week from the date the term work was made available for pickup. Unfortunately, I am unable to accept late re-marking requests.  Academic Integrity In this course, you will work with texts, objects, and digital artifacts. As you navigate the world of digital cultural heritage and write for a wider public, you are allowed (indeed, encouraged!) to use the work of others \u0026ndash; but you must carefully and conscientiously acknowledge your sources, give credit where credit is due, and respect the University of Toronto\u0026rsquo;s expectations of academic integrity.\nAcknowledgments This syllabus was originally written by Alexandra Bolintineanu, and draws on both Kristen Mapes\u0026rsquo; Introduction to Digital Humanities, AL285 and on Miriam Posner\u0026rsquo;s DH101: Introduction to Digital Humanities Fall 2014, UCLA.\nCourse Overview (Subject to Change) 1 (May. 06) Introduction to Digital Humanities What is “Digital Humanities”? We discuss the range of projects, activities, and concerns of this growing field, and collaboratively survey representative projects from around the world. We discuss DH in relation to the theme of the course, banned books.\nTool Workshop: Twine  How do digital media change possibilities for humanists to express themselves and craft persuasive arguments? We experiment via a popular game-design tool.  2 (May. 08) The Anatomy of DH Projects We discuss the components of digital humanities projects—data, code, tools, platforms, standards and communities of practice—as they manifest across a gallery of projects, living or dead. We investigate success, failure, and sustainability in DH projects. We collaboratively analyze two DH projects, peering “under the hood” of their technical framework and examining their research questions, digital artifacts, user experiences and intended audiences, and disciplinary implications.\nReadings and Discussion:  Miriam Posner, “How Did They Make That?” (2013) Alan Galey \u0026amp; Stan Ruecker, “How a Prototype Argues” (2010) (in-class discussion)  Reflection Handed Out: DH Project Profile Due May 13\n3 (May. 13) Endangered Knowledge 1: Rare Books \u0026amp; Digital Archives The first part of class is devoted to understanding the main course assignment, with some lecture material about endangered knowledge\nTools Workshop: Omeka A very brief intro to Omeka, the framework we\u0026rsquo;ll use to build your class projects.\nClass Outing: Banned and Censored Books We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library under the guidance of Tim Stinson, Cataloguer and Reference Librarian at the Library, and are introduced to the candidate books for your final projects.\nPlease Note: due to an unfortunate scheduling difficulty, our only window for this visit is 12:00-1:30 today. I am hopeful that everyone in the class can stay for this entire period.\n4 (May. 15) Digital Texts: Reading and Writing Endangered ‘book’: oral poetry, cultural memory\n Kinds of danger, types of responses Using digital methods to discover and highlight new understanding of literary texts  Readings \u0026amp; Discussion:  Lisa Samuels and Jerome J.
