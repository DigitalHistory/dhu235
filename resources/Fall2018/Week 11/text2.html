<h1>Learning Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Digital Humanities (DH) is a discipline at the intersections of the humanities with computing. </li>
<li>Digital humanists analyze languages through digital text collections; build digital archives of forbidden books; resurrect historical cities through digital maps; or construct video games to study literature.</li>
<li>This year the course focuses on endangered books: fragile, hidden, censored, forbidden. We speak to scholars who build archives of forbidden literature. We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. We study rare booksâ€™ histories through digital exhibits. </li>
<li>By the end of the course, you will have mastered concepts and technologies you can use in future courses and workplaces: data visualization, data analysis, and digital exhibit platforms. And you will learn how our stories and cultural conversations work and shapeshift through digital environments. </li>
</ul>
