** Learning Goals

  :END:

- Digital Humanities (DH) is a discipline at the intersections of the humanities with computing.
- Digital humanists analyze languages through digital text collections; build digital archives of forbidden books; resurrect historical cities through digital maps; or construct video games to study literature.
- This year the course focuses on endangered books: fragile, hidden, censored, forbidden. We speak to scholars who build archives of forbidden literature. We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. We study rare books' histories through digital exhibits.
- By the end of the course, you will have mastered concepts and technologies you can use in future courses and workplaces: data visualization, data analysis, and digital exhibit platforms. And you will learn how our stories and cultural conversations work and shapeshift through digital environments.

** By the end of the course:
