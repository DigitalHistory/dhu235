<h1>Introduction 
to Digital Humanities</h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Course Topics</h1>
<ul>
<li>Digital Humanities: A History </li>
<li>Anatomy of DH Projects</li>
<li>Archives: Endangered, Lost, Banned, Censored Books (visit to Thomas Fischer Rare Book Library)</li>
<li>How to Read with DH Data: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Tell Stories, Play Games</li>
<li>Interfaces, Users, and Usability </li>
<li>Communities, Libraries, and Possible Futures</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Learning Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Digital Humanities (DH) is a discipline at the intersections of the humanities with computing. </li>
<li>Digital humanists analyze languages through digital text collections; build digital archives of forbidden books; resurrect historical cities through digital maps; or construct video games to study literature.</li>
<li>This year the course focuses on endangered books: fragile, hidden, censored, forbidden. We speak to scholars who build archives of forbidden literature. We visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. We study rare books’ histories through digital exhibits. </li>
<li>By the end of the course, you will have mastered concepts and technologies you can use in future courses and workplaces: data visualization, data analysis, and digital exhibit platforms. And you will learn how our stories and cultural conversations work and shapeshift through digital environments. </li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">By the end of the course:</h1>
<ul>
<li>You will be able to describe the history and intellectual landscape of the digital humanities, including central concepts, debates, digital tools and platforms current in the discipline. </li>
<li>You will be able to analyze digital humanities research projects across a variety of humanities disciplines</li>
<li>You will have developed critical thinking and a set of best practices around data modeling, datasets, project design and management, and research data management</li>
<li>You will have analyzed and built visualizations and digital maps </li>
<li>You will have researched and authored your own digital exhibit</li>
</ul>
