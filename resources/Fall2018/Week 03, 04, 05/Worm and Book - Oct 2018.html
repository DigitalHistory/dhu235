<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>I want to begin with a riddle.  It’s from the Old English Exeter Book, a tenth-century manuscript that contains Old English poetry and prose—and includes a collection of riddle poems, like this one.  The most frequent solution is Moth or Bookworm:  a creature that devours books and so swallows up human knowledge and its “strong foundation” without understanding.</p>

<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Here’s an example of bookworm damage in a manuscript.  Eric Kwakkel writes:  “The most peculiar thing about the holes [bookworms] left behind is that they usually stop halfway the book. It is as if the worm, finished with his meal, turned around and traced his steps back to the restaurant’s exit. Like a satisfied customer.”</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>How are digital archives created?  For my first example—the digitization of physical collections--I want to draw on work at the Internet Archive—work I had the privilege of witnessing thanks to Andrea Mills, at the Internet Archive scanning centre here in Robarts Library. The Internet Archive, a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco"><u>San Francisco</u></a>–based nonprofit&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_library"><u>digital library</u></a>&nbsp;whose stated mission is &quot;universal access to all knowledge&quot;.  The Internet Archive provides free public access to collections of digitized materials, including books, movies, software, music, and websites.  On the 7th floor of Robarts, the Internet Archive digitizes books—from Fisher Rare Books Library; from other UofT libraries; and from all over Canada.  In the slides that follow, I want to trace the journey of these materials from physical artifact to digital surrogate.</p>

<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Digitization requires very specialized equipment and expertise.  Before digitization can begin, materials travel to the scanning centre.  Some books travel in humble cardboard boxes, like this stack of yearbooks from Vancouver College.</p>

<h2>Internet Archive:  Materials for digitization.  Photo:  A. Bolintineanu, 2016.</h2>
<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Other materials travel in style—in this case, in enclosed archival boxes that themselves travel in padded wooden crates very much like vampire coffins (because, like vampires, these books are fragile and long-lived, travellers from an earlier time).  </p>

<h2>Digitisation of a Dunhuang manuscript (Pictured:  De Vere 480 camera.  Wikipedia:  International Dunhuang Project, 2006.)</h2>
<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Once you have assembled your material, digitization work can begin. You’ll need a specialized camera that can capture the colours of your manuscript, the tiny details (some not visible to the naked eye), erasures, scribal doodles, the marginal notes written by scribes and readers over the years, even bookworm damage.  You’ll need a cradle to support the manuscript.  You’ll need a conservation-friendly room, where you can control all the light sources, to make sure you take the clearest, most accurate photograph.</p>

<p>Here is a specialized scanner as used by the Fisher Library.  Notice the black book cradle under the book, and colour calibration strip on the right-hand side of the book.  These help ensure archival-quality images.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Here is a specialized scanning station from the Internet Archive’s outpost on the seventh floor of Robarts.  Notice the curtains around the station, ensuring a minimum of light interference; the bright light on the scanner itself; the computer screen, to check the quality of the scan; and the book cradle, holding the book half-open so as not to injure its spine.  On the seventh floor of Robarts, in the Internet Archive’s quarters, there are seven or eight such digitization stations, each in its own cocoon of drapery and with its own overhead light.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Digital archives are not vulnerable to bookworms.  But they are fragile – more fragile – in different ways.  To illustrate this fragility, let’s consider the story of the two Doomsday Books.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Doomsday Book</h1>
<h2><b>1086</b></h2>
<h2><b>1986</b></h2>
<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Let me tell you the story of the two Doomsday Books.  The firsts is a Latin manuscript of the eleventh century:  for taxation purposes, William the Conqueror ordered a record made of landholders and their property in much of England and parts of Wales.  The book was finished in 1086 and it resides at The National Archives at Kew, London.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second Doomsday Book was a BBC initiative, 900 years later:  an attempt to build a “digital snapshot of the country,” a documentation of everyday life in communities around the United Kingdom. Over a million people contributed.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">The BBC Domesday Project was stored on adapted laser discs.  Reading these discs required a state-of-the-art microcomputer, the Acorn BBC Master, customized with a specially produced laserdisc player.

<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, as the machines became obsolete, the laser discs and the data on them became unreadable.  Until, roughly, 2011.  After efforts by academics and technologists around the world, the BBC’s own technologists, George Auckland and his Innovations Team, completed the extraction of the laser disc.  The BBC Domesday Book is now available to the world at large online.</p>

<h2><i>Beowulf</i> on Scantron (photo by A. Bolintineanu).</h2>
<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>What can born-digital projects do to prevent losing data to obsolescence?  Let’s take a look at another project:  U of T’s very own Dictionary of Old English.  It lives on the fourteenth floor of Robarts.  The DOE studies the earliest form of the English language, from 600 to 1150. Founded in 1970 at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/"><u>University of Toronto</u></a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://tapor.library.utoronto.ca/doe"><u>Dictionary</u></a>&nbsp;and its&nbsp;<a href="http://tapor.library.utoronto.ca/doecorpus-trial/"><u>Old English corpus</a> </u>predate the Internet by more than a decade.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the early seventies, the Dictionary of Old English Project created an electronic corpus (a body of texts) that included at least one version of every known Old English text—typed on a typewriter onto Scantron sheets, because time on the mainframe computer was very expensive (Ashley Crandell Amos, &quot;Computers and Lexicography: The Dictionary of Old English,&quot; Editing, Publishing, and Computer Technology, AMS Press, Inc., 1988).  These Scantron sheets were scanned, and so the text was digitized.  The piece you see above is from the Old English poem Beowulf:</p>

<p>HWÆT, WE GAR-DEna in geardagum,&nbsp;
þeodcyninga þrym gefrunon,&nbsp;
hu ða æþelingas ellen fremedon!&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Listen, we have heard of the Spear-danes in days of old, the kings of the people and their glory, how the princes performed deeds of courage.)</p>

<h2><b>Risky</b></h2>

<li>Own machine:  YIKES</li>
<li>Dropbox or Google Drive:  better, but not perfect</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Safer</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Multiple backups off-site</li>
<li>GitHub (version control)</li>
<li>Institutional repository (i.e. the library) with technical safeguards against data degradation</li>
<li>LOCKSS:  distributed network of institutional repositories</li>
<li>Dark archives:  secret, inaccessible archives (disaster recovery)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Storing the data on your own machine is very risky.  If you put it in Dropbox or Google Drive, that’s better, but not perfect:  what if you or a team member deletes the data by accident? Even better if you have multiple off-site backups:  so if e.g. Dropbox has a security failure and your own computer is compromised, you can still get your data from the hard-drive at your parents’. Even better:  GitHub (which is a platform that tracks versions of your data, where you have the history of your data and can go back to earlier versions). </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you’re a research institution, you have some other, even safer options.  </p>
<p>Your institutional repository is maintained by the library:  it’s a place to park your data that has sophisticated technical safeguards against data degradation.</p>
<p>If one institutional repository is nice, more are even better.  LOCKSS is an open-source preservation system that sustains a distributed network of institutional repositories.  It’s like storing your backup hard-drive at your parents’ and having them store their hard-drive at your house.  In other words, everyone protects everyone else’s data.  LOCKSS stands for “lots of copies keep stuff safe.”  And for additional protection, there are dark archives, for disaster recovery.  These keep data secret and inaccessible until a trigger event such as a natural disaster or another kind of catastrophic data loss. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Hardware and Software Platforms</h1>
<h2><b>Risky</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Dedicated, unique software platforms made by commercial providers to fit your data beautifully.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Safer</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Open-source, community-supported software</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>How long do hardware and software platforms live?  What’s their life expectancy?</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Preservation Approaches</h1>
<h2><b>Migration</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Moving your data from an obsolete, less stable platform and format into a newer, more stable platform and format.  </li>
<li>Great for simpler digital objects (text, images)</li>
<li>Example:  DOE data.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Emulation</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>In a new, stable software platform, recreating the—now obsolete—original environment of a digital object</li>
<li>Good for complicated digital objects (software)</li>
<li>Example:  old arcade video games.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Think about the residential school system in Canada, under which about 150,000 First Nation, Inuit and Métis&nbsp;children were removed from their communities, forced to attend residential schools, not allowed to speak their first language, not allowed to practice native traditions.  Many were starved, beaten, sexually abused.  Two days ago, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne officially apologized to First Nations, Metis, and Inuit communities for the abuses of the residential school system.  Part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s work has been to uncover this history.  It is not recovery.  It is not undoing of cultural genocide.  But, and I quote the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, “A shared vision held by those affected by Indian residential schools was to create a place of learning and dialogue where the truths of their experiences were honoured and kept safe for future generations. They wanted their families, communities and all of Canada to learn from these hard lessons so they would not be repeated.”  The Governing Circle of the archive must “ensure Indigenous control over the materials, ensure Indigenous control over the materials; provide guidance on policies, activities, ceremonies and protocols; and provide guidance on methods and sources for expanding the Centre’s holdings and resources.”  The archive does not turn back time.  But it safeguards the past and, in so doing, opens up possible futures.</p>

<h2>“In 2007, Warumungu community members collaborated with Kim Christen and Craig Dietrich to produce the Mukurtu Wumpurrarni-kari Archive. </h2>
<h2>Mukurtu is a Warumungu word meaning ‘dilly bag’ or a safe keeping place for sacred materials. Warumungu elder, Michael Jampin Jones chose Mukurtu as the name for the community archive to remind users that the archive, too, is a safe keeping place where Warumungu people can share stories, knowledge, and cultural materials properly using their own protocols. </h2>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>I want to begin with a riddle.  It’s from the Old English Exeter Book, a tenth-century manuscript that contains Old English poetry and prose—and includes a collection of riddle poems, like this one.  The most frequent solution is Moth or Bookworm:  a creature that devours books and so swallows up human knowledge and its “strong foundation” without understanding.</p>
