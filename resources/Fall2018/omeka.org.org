  :END:

- In the Item's fields, enter the metadata: Title, Subject, Description, etc. Before you add items to your collection, you will have figured out how the Dublin Core metadata schema applies to your particular data: consistency across your collection is key.
- For example, for medieval manuscripts, you can list authors of the texts under Author: but what of known scribes, who may have also intervened in the text? Are they Authors or Publishers or Contributors? Pick what makes sense and apply it consistently.
- For details on Dublin Core :
- http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/
- If you wish the Item to be visible on the public view of the site, check “Public” (under “Add Item”).
- Click “Add Item” (green, right).
