- What “counts” cannot necessarily be counted
- Data representation = interpretation:
- The process of modelling and collecting our data is an interpretive process that is shaped by our choices re. what aspects of the data we model; by our research question, argument, perspective, discipline, social context, institutional context, tools available etc.

"Who are those dots? Each individual had a profile, age, size, health, economic potential, family and social roles. [...] But what if we take the rate of deaths, their frequency, and chart that on a temporal axis inflected by increasing panic. Then give a graphical expression to the shape of the terrain, that urban streetscape, as it is redrawn to express the emotional landscape. Then imagine drawing this same streetscape from the point of view of a mother of six young children, a recent widow, a small child, or an elderly man whose son has just died" (Drucker, “Humanities Approaches”).

- Johanna Drucker: graphesis = “the field of knowledge production embodied in visual expressions ... a visual epistemology” (Drucker, “Graphesis” 2011)
- Visual forms carry the assumptions and values of their fields of origin, and impose these assumptions and values on the data they present, whether these assumptions and values are appropriate to that data or not.
- As humanists, we ask ourselves: What arguments, values, and perspectives do visualizations encode and embody? What kind of knowledge do they produce? What field's assumptions do they draw from?

*** “This figure is James Hemings, Thomas Jefferson's enslaved personal chef (and Sally Hemings's older brother). When Jefferson was appointed Ambassador to France, he took Hemings with him to Paris, and there apprenticed him to the chef of a prince. Through the few archival records that relate to Hemings, we also know, for instance, that while in Paris, Hemings hired his own tutor and learned to speak fluent French. And here's another thing Hemings learned in Paris: what it might mean to be free. [...]

*** It is then a striking instantiation of archival silence that when you perform a “Name” search for a person named James Hemings in the /The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Digital Edition/, you get no results---because Hemings, in spite of his ability to read and write in two languages--because of his status as a slave--was not a person to whom Jefferson ever wrote, or from whom Jefferson received letters.”
