Organizational culture and user community create a “behavioural and interpretive template” for the use of a technology.
- Technology-in-practice: not only the technology itself, but “the ways it is extended, adapted, used, and misused by a specific user community---whether by ignoring an entire set of functions, or by extending its functionality through plugins or customizations, or by using it for purposes never foreseen by its designers. More briefly, technology-in-practice is “*what people actually do with the technological artifact in their recurrent, situated practices*.” (Orlikowski, Wanda J. “Using Technology and Constituting Structures: A Practice Lens for Studying Technology in Organizations.” /Organization Science/, vol. 11, no. 4, 2000, pp. 404--428. www.jstor.org/stable/2640412.)

[E]ven doorknobs have politics in that they may be round, requiring a human hand to turn them, or shaped as levers, such that a person with a prosthetic limb or an armload of groceries with one free elbow can still successfully use them. This is more than simply a matter of utility. Both designs are political in that they presume and construct different kinds of worlds, with the round doorknob presuming a world in which everyone's bodies are the same, and in which hands with opposable thumbs and sufficient grip strength are always available (Galey, Alan, and Stan Ruecker. “How a Prototype Argues.” /Literary and Linguistic Computing/ 25.4 (2010): 405-24.

- *Sciences* vs. *humanities*: “assumptions of *knowledge as observer-independent and certain*, rather than *observer co-dependent and interpretative*.

- “When you call something data, you imply that it exists in discrete, fungible units; that it is computationally tractable; that its meaningful qualities can be enumerated in a finite list; that someone else performing the same operations on the same data will come up with the same results. This is not how humanists think of the material they work with.” ([[http://miriamposner.com/blog/humanities-data-a-necessary-contradiction/][http://miriamposner.com/blog/humanities-data-a-necessary-contradiction/]])

- Metadata is structured data describing data. Think Author, Title, Date, Subject in your online library catalogue
- Standard metadata schemas include Dublin Core, MARC, and MODS (each of these schemas has a different set of information it collects).

Individual item metadata includes title, creator, description, source, rights, etc: the elements of the Dublin Core metadata schema.

Each record of an archive is described by metadata: structured data about data. For example, think about your library's online catalogue: it contains the records of books, with fields like Author, Title, Publisher, Editor, Date. If you use standard metadata schemas, like Dublin Core, MARC, or MODS, your data will be discoverable and interoperable with aggregators and library catalogues.
