<h1>Introduction to Omeka</h1>
<ul>
<li>A. Bolintineanu</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Learning Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>By  the end of this tutorial, participants  will:</li>
<li>Understand the building blocks of Omeka as a content management  system and data curation platform</li>
<li>Know how to navigate Omeka sites (private and public views)</li>
<li>Understand the basics of Dublin Core metadata schema</li>
<li>Be able to add items (individually), enable plugins, create  collections, and build exhibits</li>
<li>Be able to manipulate the appearance of Omeka sites</li>
<li>Be able to create custom pages in Omeka</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Omeka</h1>
<ul>
<li>Omeka = “Wordpress for museums”:</li>
<ul>
<li>Allows users to build digital archives of  books, images, recordings, performances,  and many other kinds of items</li>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Open-source</li>
<li>Wide community uptake</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Items &amp;  Collections</h1>
<ul>
<li>Users can curate  collections of digital  items</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font color="#FFFFFF">Images</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font color="#FFFFFF">Audio</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font color="#FFFFFF">Videos</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font color="#FFFFFF">Performances</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font color="#FFFFFF">Lesson Plans</font></li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Metadata</h1>
<ul>
<li>Users can create rigorous  metadata (Dublin Core standard)  for each item</li>
<li>Discoverability &amp; interoperability  with aggregators and library  catalogues</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Storytelling</h1>
<ul>
<li>Through its Exhibit plugin,  Omeka lets users tell  stories with their  collections.</li>
<li>Users can arrange items  from their collections into  multimedia essays, using  the “Lego bricks” of the  archive to tell stories and  make arguments.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">http://silveragecomics.uncc.edu/</h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Heroes and Villains:  Silver Age Comics</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Heroes and Villains </b>is a  digital archive of Silver  Age superhero comic  books from J. Murrey  Atkins Library Special  Collections. Credits:  Marc Bess, <u><font color="#0462C1">J. Murrey </u> <u>Atkins Library  Digital Scholarship Lab</u></font>,  UNC Charlotte.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Omeka’s Building Blocks</h1>
<ul>
<li>Items (= content of Omeka)</li>
<li>Metadata (= information about information – Dublin Core metadata  schema)</li>
<li>Collections (= a group of items; an item can be in only one collection  at a time)</li>
<li>Exhibits (= a narrative woven around some items; an item can be in as  many exhibits as desired)</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Items</h1>
<ul>
<li>Items are the building  blocks of Omeka  collections.	They  have metadata (Title,  Description, Source,  Date, etc.) and may  have digital files  attached.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Metadata</h1>
<ul>
<li>Metadata is structured data about  data.</li>
<li>For example, think about your  library’s online catalogue:	it  contains the records of books,  about which it tracks items of</li>
<li>information such as Author, Title,  Publisher, Editor, Date.</li>
<li>The metadata schema that  underlies Omeka is Dublin Core, a  basic yet internationally accepted  metadata schema.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Collections</h1>
<ul>
<li>Collections are  logical groupings  or “folders” of  Items.	An item  can be in only  one Collection at  a time.</li>
<li>Click on “Browse  Collections”</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Exhibits</h1>
<ul>
<li>Exhibits are narratives woven  around some items, telling their  story and explaining their  significance.	An item can be in  as many exhibits as you, the  curator, desire.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Heroes and Villains:  Silver Age Comics</h1>
<ul>
<li>Exhibit: <u><b><font color="#0462C1">DC Women of the Silver Age</b></u></font>. The  exhibit is an Omeka Exhibit, a digital narrative  showcasing a selection of Items from the  collection. Note the exhibit’s structure on  the left.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Get Started</h1>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to our course Omeka site:</li>
<li>https://spatial-humanities.library.utoronto.ca/admin/</li>
<li>Your user name is wdw235; your password is fall2018.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to Omeka’s Dashboard, the back-end access to the Omeka site. On the left, the options you need are:  Items; Collections; and Exhibits.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an item</h1>
<ul>
<li>Go to Dashboard and select “Items”</li>
<li>Select “Add an Item”</li>
<li>Fill in the metadata fields</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an item:	Dublin Core Metadata</h1>
<ul>
<li>In the Item’s fields, enter the metadata: Title,  Subject, Description, etc.	Before you add items  to your collection, you will have figured out how  the Dublin Core metadata schema applies to your  particular data: consistency across your  collection is key.</li>
<li>For example, for medieval manuscripts, you can  list authors of the texts under Author: but what  of known scribes, who may have also intervened  in the text? Are they Authors or Publishers or  Contributors? Pick what makes sense and apply  it consistently.</li>
<li>For details on Dublin Core :</li>
<li><u><font color="#0462C1">http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/</u></font></li>
<li>If you wish the Item to be visible on the public  view of the site, check “Public” (under “Add  Item”).</li>
<li>Click “Add Item” (green, right).</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an item:	Dublin Core Metadata</h1>
<ul>
<li>In this assignment, you are responsible for the following fields (and some may have to stay blank):</li>
<li>Title; </li>
<li>Description (a paragraph recording your description of the object, in your own words: 100-200 words)</li>
<li>Creator; </li>
<li>Source (can be e.g. manuscript or book or collection); </li>
<li>Publisher; </li>
<li>Date; </li>
<li>Rights (i.e. who owns copyright – language here will vary strongly depending on institution the items come from, and that is not an error on the students’ part); </li>
<li>Format material, e.g. bronze, parchment, etc.); </li>
<li>Language; </li>
<li>Coverage (place where the object is from/was made). </li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an Item:	Success</h1>
<ul>
<li>Success:	our trial item  (“New Item”) was created  and added to the digital  collection!</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an Image to the Item</h1>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Items and select the “Edit” option under your Item</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<ul>
<li>From the top horizontal row of options of the Item: select Files Choose File</li>
<li>Upload your image</li>
<li>Save changes</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Omeka’s Building Blocks:	Collections</h1>
<ul>
<li>Collections are logical groupings or “folders” of Items. An item can be in only one Collection at a time.</li>
<li>Go to Dashboard and select “Collections”</li>
<li>Select “Add a Collection”</li>
<li>Fill in the metadata elements as desired, as for Item. (Everything in Omeka has metadata: it is turtles  all the way down.)</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Omeka’s Building Blocks:	Collections</h1>
<ul>
<li>Collections are logical groupings or “folders” of Items. An item can be in only one Collection at a time.</li>
<li>Go to Dashboard and select “Collections”</li>
<li>Select “Add a Collection”</li>
<li>Fill in the metadata elements, as for Item. </li>
<li>Please use WDW235 – Your Last Name as your Collection title.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an Exhibit:	Plan</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Exhibit is a narrative pathway through the collection; or, if you will,  a digital essay based on the items in your collection.</li>
<li>First write the prose for your exhibit and decide what items need to  appear in it.</li>
<li>To look pretty in the Exhibit, the items need to have picture or video  files attached.</li>
<li>Save  your prose in a separate file.	</li>
<li>Put your immortal prose  somewhere safe.	<b><font color="#FF0000">Omeka Exhibits cannot be exported automatically:  and if you ever delete yours in error, there is no getting it back.</b></font></li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an Exhibit: Structure</h1>
<ul>
<li>An Omeka Exhibit  has:</li>
<ul>
<li>An overview page:   displays an abstract  (summary) of your  exhibit</li>
<li>Pages: sections of your exhibit; these display text as well as  items (remember, to  look pretty, the items  need to have files  attached)</li>
<li>In each Page:  blocks</li>
<li>Pages are about content; Blocks are about layout/format</li>
</ul>
<li>You get to decide the  content and layout of  your pages.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an Exhibit:	Creation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Dashboard and click on Exhibits.</li>
<li>Click Add an Exhibit.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an  Exhibit:  Metadata</h1>
<ul>
<li>Every Exhibit has  metadata.</li>
<li>Title displays as the  Exhibits title.</li>
<li>Slug forms the URL.</li>
<li>Description is an  abstract of the  Exhibit that appears  on its first page.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an Exhibit:  Structure</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Exhibit consists of Pages.</li>
<li>Each Page is a section of your  Exhibit.</li>
<li>To build your Exhibit, start  adding Pages by clicking the Add  Page  green button.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an Exhibit:	Pages</h1>
<ul>
<li>Each Page may consist of multiple  blocks:</li>
<ul>
<li>Text and an item block</li>
<li>A gallery of items block</li>
<li>Text block</li>
</ul>
<li>To create a new Block, click on the  desired layout.	This block will be  added as a section of this page.  Your page can contain as many  blocks as you like; you can drag  them around to rearrange them.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an Exhibit:	Blocks</h1>
<ul>
<li>Once you add a block, enter your  narrative in the window labelled  Text.</li>
<li>Then click on the Add Item  button to add items that  illustrate your narrative.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an Exhibit:	Blocks</h1>
<ul>
<li>c</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Once you have added your  narrative and selected your  Items, your block will look like  this:</li>
<li>To see what the Page actually  looks like, select the View Publi  Page button (right side of  browser, in line with Content).</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Add an Exhibit:	Overall Design</h1>
<ul>
<li>In your finished Exhibit, each Page will be a Section of  the Narrative, illustrated with Items from your digital  collection.</li>
<li>You can use and reuse items from your collection in as  many Exhibits as you wish.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Appearance</h1>
<ul>
<li>You can customize the  appearance of your  Omeka site by configuring  its theme (i.e. colours,  fonts, and layout of the  site, or even of an  individual exhibit) and  adding a logo image.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Appearance</h1>
<ul>
<li>To configure the theme and add  a header image to your Omeka  site, first find or create that  image.</li>
<li>Go to Dashboard</li>
<li>From the horizontal top menu,  select Appearance</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Appearance</h1>
<ul>
<li>Choose from the themes  available.	Your choice of theme  will determine the fonts, colour  scheme, and layout of your site  (or of your exhibit).</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Appearance</h1>
<ul>
<li>To configure your theme  or add a logo for your site,  select “Configure Theme.”</li>
<li>Then add a logo or header  image, paying attention to  file size restrictions.</li>
<li>Save changes.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Building an Omeka Site:  Conclusions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make a project plan with deadlines. But allow for disasters.</li>
<li>Plan your exhibits (possibly on paper) well ahead of time</li>
<li><b>Draft and save your <font color="#FF0000">Item</font> descriptions and your <font color="#FF0000">Exhibit</font> content in word processing software; save this draft; </b></li>
<li>Paste your content from Word into Omeka.</li>
</ul>
