We rise; one wand'ring thought pollutes the day.

I had been the author of unalter-  able evils; and I lived in daily fear, lest the monster whom  I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I  had an obscure feeling that all was not over, and that he  would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity  should almost efface the recollection of the past. There was  always scope for fear, so long as any thing I loved remained  behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived.  When I thought of him, I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became  inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which  I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his  crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds  of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest  peak of the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated  him to their base. I wished to see him again, that I might  wreak the utmost extent of anger on his head, and avenge  the deaths of William and Justine.","":"","generated":"123"},{"location":"62Belrivech8","latitude":"46.2514","longitude":"6.2023","coords":"46.2514, 6.2023","pagenumber":"62","map_order":"","pagenumber_first":"62","pagenumber_last":"64","loc_name_shelley":"Belrive","loc_name_18c":"Collonge sur Bellerive","loc_name_modern":"Collonge-Bellerive, Switzerland","loc_type":"loc_zone","action_emotive_victor":"anger","action_emotive_creature":"","action_emotive_walton":"","action_emotive_clerval":"","action_emotive_alphonse":"sadness","action_emotive_caroline":"","action_emotive_elizabeth":"sadness","action_emotive_william":"","action_emotive_justine":"","action_emotive_felix":"","action_emotive_safie":"","action_emotive_agatha":"","action_emotive_delacey":"","action_emotive_waldman":"","action_emotive_krempe":"","action_emotive_kirwin":"","action_emotive_ernest":"","action_physical_victor":"action_physical_hiding","action_physical_creature":"","action_physical_walton":"","action_physical_clerval":"","action_physical_alphonse":"","action_physical_caroline":"","action_physical_elizabeth":"action_physical_dialogue","action_physical_william":"","action_physical_justine":"","action_physical_felix":"","action_physical_safie":"","action_physical_agatha":"","action_physical_waldman":"","action_physical_krempe":"","action_physical_kirwin":"","action_physical_ernest":"","nature_setting":"","nature_loc":"nature_loc_interior","nature_aesthetic":"nature_aesthetic_na","nature_weather":"","nature_time":"","nature_topography":"nature_valley","name_narrator":"Victor","name_actant1":"Victor","name_actant2":"Elizabeth","name_actant3":"Alphonse","name_actant4":"","name_actant5":"","name_ref1":"Creature","name_ref2":"Justine","name_ref3":"William","name_ref4":"Caroline ","name_ref5":"","name_book1":"tales of ancient days","name_book2":"","name_book3":"","name_book4":"","name_book5":"","extract":"About this time we retired to our house at Belrive.

His friends mourn and weep, but he is gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a fit subject for pity; the survivors are the greatest sufferers, and for them time is the only consolation. Those maxims of the Stoics, that death was no evil, and that the mind of man ought to be superior to despair on the eternal absence of a beloved object, ought not to be urged. Even Cato wept over the dead body of his brother.” Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in solitude.

The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion.” (Shelley 2012:45-46)","":"","generated":"198"},{"location":"49montblancv1ch6","latitude":"45.8326","longitude":"6.8652","coords":"45.8326, 6.8652","pagenumber":"49","map_order":"","pagenumber_first":"49","pagenumber_last":"49","loc_name_shelley":"Mont Blanc","loc_name_18c":"Le Mont Blanc","loc_name_modern":"Le Mont Blanc","loc_type":"loc_zone","action_emotive_victor":"sadness","action_emotive_creature":"","action_emotive_walton":"","action_emotive_clerval":"","action_emotive_alphonse":"","action_emotive_caroline":"","action_emotive_elizabeth":"","action_emotive_william":"","action_emotive_justine":"","action_emotive_felix":"","action_emotive_safie":"","action_emotive_agatha":"","action_emotive_delacey":"","action_emotive_waldman":"","action_emotive_krempe":"","action_emotive_kirwin":"","action_emotive_ernest":"","action_physical_victor":"action_physical_travelling","action_physical_creature":"","action_physical_walton":"","action_physical_clerval":"","action_physical_alphonse":"","action_physical_caroline":"","action_physical_elizabeth":"","action_physical_william":"","action_physical_justine":"","action_physical_felix":"","action_physical_safie":"","action_physical_agatha":"","action_physical_waldman":"","action_physical_krempe":"","action_physical_kirwin":"","action_physical_ernest":"","nature_setting":"nature_setting_wilderness","nature_loc":"nature_loc_exterior","nature_aesthetic":"nature_aesthetic_beautiful","nature_weather":"nature_weather_thunderstorm","nature_time":"nature_time_night","nature_topography":"nature_mountain","name_narrator":"Victor","name_actant1":"Victor","name_actant2":"","name_actant3":"","name_actant4":"","name_actant5":"","name_ref1":"Salêve","name_ref2":"The Juras","name_ref3":"","name_ref4":"","name_ref5":"","name_book1":"","name_book2":"","name_book3":"","name_book4":"","name_book5":"","extract":"“During this short voyage I saw the lightnings playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures.

Unable to rest or sleep, she quitted her asylum early, that she might again endeavor to find my brother.” (Shelley 2012:55)","":"","generated":"243"},{"location":"64bridgeofPelissierch8","latitude":"45.915","longitude":"6.772","coords":"45.915, 6.772","pagenumber":"64","map_order":"","pagenumber_first":"64","pagenumber_last":"64","loc_name_shelley":"bridge of Pelissier","loc_name_18c":" le pont Pélissier","loc_name_modern":" le pont Pélissier","loc_type":"loc_path","action_emotive_victor":"","action_emotive_creature":"","action_emotive_walton":"","action_emotive_clerval":"","action_emotive_alphonse":"","action_emotive_caroline":"","action_emotive_elizabeth":"","action_emotive_william":"","action_emotive_justine":"","action_emotive_felix":"","action_emotive_safie":"","action_emotive_agatha":"","action_emotive_delacey":"","action_emotive_waldman":"","action_emotive_krempe":"","action_emotive_kirwin":"","action_emotive_ernest":"","action_physical_victor":"","action_physical_creature":"","action_physical_walton":"","action_physical_clerval":"","action_physical_alphonse":"","action_physical_caroline":"","action_physical_elizabeth":"","action_physical_william":"","action_physical_justine":"","action_physical_felix":"","action_physical_safie":"","action_physical_agatha":"","action_physical_waldman":"","action_physical_krempe":"","action_physical_kirwin":"","action_physical_ernest":"","nature_setting":"nature_setting_rural","nature_loc":"nature_loc_exterior","nature_aesthetic":"nature_aesthetic_sublime","nature_weather":"nature_weather_na","nature_time":"","nature_topography":"nature_valley","name_narrator":"Victor","name_actant1":"Victor","name_actant2":"Alphonse","name_actant3":"Ernest","name_actant4":"Elizabeth","name_actant5":"","name_ref1":"","name_ref2":"","name_ref3":"","name_ref4":"","name_ref5":"","name_book1":"","name_book2":"","name_book3":"","name_book4":"","name_book5":"","extract":"We passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine,  which the river forms, opened before us,","":"","generated":"244"},{"location":"68desertmountainsv2ch2","latitude":"46.501576","longitude":"7.999708","coords":"46.501576, 7.999708","pagenumber":"68","map_order":"","pagenumber_first":"68","pagenumber_last":"68","loc_name_shelley":"Desert mountains and dreary glaciers... caves of ice","loc_name_18c":"Alps","loc_name_modern":"Alps","loc_type":"loc_action","action_emotive_victor":"","action_emotive_creature":"longing","action_emotive_walton":"","action_emotive_clerval":"","action_emotive_alphonse":"","action_emotive_caroline":"","action_emotive_elizabeth":"","action_emotive_william":"","action_emotive_justine":"","action_emotive_felix":"","action_emotive_safie":"","action_emotive_agatha":"","action_emotive_delacey":"","action_emotive_waldman":"","action_emotive_krempe":"","action_emotive_kirwin":"","action_emotive_ernest":"","action_physical_victor":"","action_physical_creature":"action_physical_hiding","action_physical_walton":"","action_physical_clerval":"","action_physical_alphonse":"","action_physical_caroline":"","action_physical_elizabeth":"","action_physical_william":"","action_physical_justine":"","action_physical_felix":"","action_physical_safie":"","action_physical_agatha":"","action_physical_waldman":"","action_physical_krempe":"","action_physical_kirwin":"","action_physical_ernest":"","nature_setting":"nature_setting_wilderness","nature_loc":"nature_loc_exterior","nature_aesthetic":"nature_aesthetic_na","nature_weather":"nature_weather_fog","nature_time":"","nature_topography":"nature_mountain","name_narrator":"Creature","name_actant1":"Creature","name_actant2":"","name_actant3":"","name_actant4":"","name_actant5":"","name_ref1":"Victor","name_ref2":"Mankind","name_ref3":"","name_ref4":"","name_ref5":"","name_book1":"","name_book2":"","name_book3":"","name_book4":"","name_book5":"","extract":" 'The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge.
