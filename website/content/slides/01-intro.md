## Goals {#goals}

By the end of this lecture, you will:

-   Be able to define: digital humanities; spatial digital humanities; GIS; virtual reality vs. augmented reality
-   Be able to think about maps as interpretations and abstractions of space


## Digital Humanities (DH) {#digital-humanities-dh}


### DH: at the fluctuating intersections of the humanities with computing {#dh-at-the-fluctuating-intersections-of-the-humanities-with-computing}

<div class="notes">
  <div></div>

-   note the influences go in two directions!
-   what does this tell us exactly?
-   not a static definition!
-   far enough away from the interface, it is just "humanities" or "computer science"

</div>


### Timeline {#section-4}

## Spatial DH {#section-5}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/spatial-hum-diagram.png" >}}


## Spatial DH {#spatial-dh}

-   Digital mapping (historical data or imaginary spaces): plotting historical or literary data (urban economy, pilgrim routes, a character's journey in a book) onto a modern, historical, or imaginary map
-   GIS (Geographical Information System): a system that stores, presents, and analyzes spatial data. Points in this system are identified by location (longitude, latitude, elevation); they are **real places on georeferenced maps**.
    -   (Well, **usually** that's true. not always!)
-   Digital archives: digital (or digitized) collections of primary documents about a place or a community; more broadly, collections of primary documents, e.g. manuscripts, annotated books, letters, photographs, etc.
-   Augmented/virtual reality: using computing to overlay virtual elements onto real landscapes (AR), or using computing tech to simulate an immersive, interactive, three-dimensional virtual environment
-   3D printing: turning a digital model into a real object through additive manufacturing (delicate layering of plastic via 3D printer machine)


## Let's start by&#x2026; {#let-s-start-by-and-x2026}

Drawing a map!

(this is even for those of us who suck at drawing)


## What is a map? {#what-is-a-map}

### Step 0: Find a partner {#step-0-find-a-partner}

-   Find a partner. Sit together at one computer and open your browser.
-   One of you will be the Navigator, clicking around.
-   The other will be the Observer, taking notes on the process.
-   Midway, you'll switch roles.


### Step I: Casual Exploration {#step-i-casual-exploration}

-   With your partner, explore the project. See what you can learn. Keep track of your work.


### Step II: Topic {#step-ii-topic}

What is the project about?

-   What topic and historical period does it focus on?
-   What texts or art works or other material does it collect, explain, map, or analyze?
-   What questions is the project seeking to answer?


### Step IV: Presentation & User Experience {#step-iv-presentation-user-experience}

-   What is the “digital artifact” through which this project communicates its findings? A book? A game? A map? An edition? An archive? A tool? Another type of digital artifact?
-   As a user external to the project, what steps did you take to explore the project? Can you understand how to read the project's data or how to use the tools it is building? As you explore the project, what do you find easy? What do you find difficult? What do you like? What do you dislike?


### Step V: Data {#step-v-data}

-   What data does the project generate? Can you download the data?
-   Does the project provide narrative context for its data (that is, does it clearly explain what its data means and why it matters, for readers not familiar with the project)?
-   Is access to project data open, subscription-only, or under a specific licence? May other scholars download the project's data?


### Step VI: Audience {#step-vi-audience}

-   Who is the intended audience for this project? That is, does this project primarily speak to laypeople or to scholars? How can you tell?


## So, what is a map? {#so-what-is-a-map}

-   representational (probably)
-   spatial (usually)
-   instrumental
-   argumentative (always, even when it's invisible)
-   legible under culturally-specific conditions


## Syllabus {#syllabus}

(Let's check Quercus)
