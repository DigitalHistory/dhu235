# Introduction to Digital Humanities

This is the website for WDW 235, _Introduction to Digital Humanities_, at the University of Toronto. All of the course materials are described in detail in the links on the sidebar; you probably want to [start with the syllabus](./syllabus/syllabus/). Tables of contents for long pages can be access via the odd list icon at the top left of the page menu.

Enjoy the class!
