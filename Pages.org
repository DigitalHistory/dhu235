Because my slides are written directly in HTML, it's difficult for me to upload them to Quercus. For that reason I host them elsewhere ([[https://digitalhistory.github.io/wdw235/slides][you can look at them in their native environment too, if you wish]]). It's a bit cumbersome to navigate among the slides here -- sorry about that!. One hint is to just press ~f~ to get a full-screen view when viewing the lecture. Another is to ~Ctrl-click~ on the links to open them in their own tabs. 

Enjoy!
